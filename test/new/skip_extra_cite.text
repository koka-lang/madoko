We propose a [programming]{.mono} model where effects are treated in a disciplined way, 
and where the potential side-effects of a function are apparent in its type
signature. The type and effect of expressions can also be inferred
automatically, and we describe a polymorphic type inference system based on
Hindley-Milner style inference. A novel feature is that we support polymorphic
effects through row-polymorphism using duplicate labels. Moreover, we show
that our effects are not just syntactic labels but have a deep semantic
connection to the program. For example, if an expression can be typed without
an _exn_ effect, then it will never throw an unhandled exception. Similar to
Haskell's `runST` we show how we can safely encapsulate stateful operations.
Through the state effect, we can also safely combine state with let-
polymorphism without needing either imperative type variables or a syntactic
value restriction. Finally,our system is implemented fully in a new language
called Koka[^koka] and has been used successfully on various small to medium-
sized sample programs ranging from a Markdown processor to a tier-splitted
chat application.

[^koka]: Koka means 'effect' or 'effective' in Japanese.


# Introduction 	{ #sec-intro }

We propose a programming model where effects are a part of the type signature
of a function. Currently, types only tell us something about the input and
output value of a function but say nothing about all _other_ behaviors; for
example, if the function writes to the console or can throw an exception. In
our system, the squaring function:

	function sqr(x : int) { x | $ * x }

will get the type: 
``` 
sqr : int -> total | $ int 
``` 
signifying that `sqr` has no
side effect at all and behaves as a total function from integers to integers.
If we add a `print` statement though:

	function sqr(x : int) { print(x); x*x }

the (inferred) type indicates that `sqr` has an input-output (`io`) effect:

	sqr : int -> io int

Note that there was no need to change the original function nor to promote the
expression `x*x` into the `io` effect. One of our goals is to make effects
convenient for the programmer, so we automatically combine effects. In
particular, this makes it convenient for the programmer to use precise effects
without having to insert coercions. For example, we can split Haskell's state
monad into three separate effects (read, allocate, and write), while
automatically combining these effects when required.

There have been many proposals for effects systems in the past [@Gifford:imperative, Chap. 5; @Lucassen:polyeffect, page 29; @Talpin:effects; @Wadler:marriage; @Nielson:polyeffect; @Benton:exceptioneffects; @Marino:genericeffects; @Leijen:effects-tr; @Scala:effects].
However, many such systems suffer from being syntactical in nature (i.e.
effects are just labels), or by being quite restricted, for example being
monomorphic or applied to a very specific set of effects. Some of the more
general systems suffer from having complicated effect types, especially in a
polymorphic setting that generally requires sub-effect constraints.

This paper has been long in the works and brings together many pieces of the
effect puzzle: ranging from effect types as rows with duplicate labels, the
semantics of effect types, and practical experience with effect inference. In
particular, we make the following contributions:

* 	We describe a novel effect system based on row polymorphism which allows
	_duplicated_ effects. It turns out that this is essential to provide natural types to effect elimination forms, like catching exceptions.

* The effect types are not just syntactic labels
	but they have a deep semantic connection to the program (Section [#sec-semeffect]). For example, we can prove that if an expression that can be typed without an _exn_ effect, then it will never throws an unhandled exception; or if an expressions can be typed without a _div_ effect, then it will always terminate.

* The interaction between polymorphism and mutable state is fraught with 
	danger. We show that by modeling state as an effect we can safely combine mutability with let-polymorphism without needing either _imperative type variables_, nor a syntactic value restriction.

	Moreover, we can safely encapsulate local state operations and we prove that such encapsulation is sound where no references or stateful behavior can escape the encapsulation scope.

	The interaction between divergence and higher-order mutable state is also tricky. Again, we show how explicit heap effects allow us to safely infer whether stateful operations may diverge.

* Having to keep track of effects manually would be a large burden: we
	describe a sound and complete type inference system that automatically infers the principal effect and type of any expression, and automatically promotes effects when necessary. (Section [#sec-inference]).

* We have an extensive experience with the type system within the 
	Koka language. The Koka language fully implements the effect types as described in this paper and we have used it successfully in various small to medium sized code examples ranging from a fully compliant
	Markdown text processor to a tier-splitted chat application.

A main contribution of this paper is showing that our notion of mutable state
is sound, in particular the combination of mutable state and polymorphic let-
bindings is tricky as shown by Tofte [-@Tofte:refs] for the ML
language. Later, variants of the ML value restriction are studied by Leroy [-@Leroy:valuerestriction].

Safe state encapsulation using a lazy state monad was first proven formally by
[@Launchbury:monadstate]{.textual}. Their formalization is
quite different though from ours and applies to a lazy store in a monadic
setting. In particular, in their formalization there is no separate heap
binding, but heaps are always bound at the outer `run`. We tried this, but it
proved difficult in our setting; for example, it is hard to state the stateful
lemma since answers would never contain an explicit heap. Very similar to our
state encapsulation is region inference [@Tofte:regioninf]. Our `run`
operation essentially delimits a heap region. Regions live at the value level
though, and we can for example not access references in several regions at
once.

Independently of our work, [@Lindley:effects]{.textual} also
used row polymorphism for effect types. Their approach is based on
presence/absence flags [@Remy:records] to give effect types to database
operations in the context of the Links web programming language. The main
effects of the database operations are _wild_, _tame_, and _hear_, for
arbitrary effects including divergence, pure queries, and asynchronous
messages respectively.They report on practical experience exposing effect
types to the programmer and discuss various syntax forms to easily denote
effect types.

The problems with arbitrary effects have been widely recognized, and there is
a large body of work studying how to delimit the scope of effects. There have
been many effect typing disciplines proposed. Early work is by Gifford and
Lucassen [-@Gifford:imperative;-@Lucassen:polyeffect] which was later
extended by Talpin [-@Talpin:thesis] and others [@Talpin:effects;@Nielson:polyeffect]. 
These systems are closely related
since they describe polymorphic effect systems and use type constraints to
give principal types. The system described by Nielson _et al._ [-@Nielson:polyeffect] 
also requires the effects to form a complete
lattice with meets and joins.

Java contains a simple effect system where each method is labeled with the
exceptions it might raise [@Gosling:java] . A system for finding uncaught
exceptions was developed for ML by [+@Pessaux:exceptions]{.textual}. 
A more powerful system for tracking effects was
developed by Benton [-@Benton:exceptioneffects] who also studies the
semantics of such effect systems [@Benton:relsemantics]. Recent work on
effects in Scala [@Scala:effects] shows how even a restricted form of
polymorphic effect types can be used to track effects for many programs in
practice.

Tolmach [-@Tolmach:monadhierarchy] describes an effect analysis for ML
in terms of effect monads, namely `Total`, `Partial`, `Divergent` and `ST`.
This is system is not polymorphic though and meant more for internal compiler
analysis. In the context proof systems there has been work to show absence of
observable side effects for object-oriented programming languages, for example
by Naumann [-@Naumann:purity].

Marino _et al._ recently produced a generic type-and-effect system [@Marino:genericeffects]. 
This system uses privilege checking to describe
analytical effect systems, and they provide a soundness proof for their type
system. For example, an effect system could use try-catch statements to grant
the `canThrow` privilege inside try blocks. `throw` statements are then only
permitted when this privilege is present. Their system is very general and can
express many properties but has no semantics on its own. For example, it would
be sound for the effect system to have "+" grant the `canThrow` privilege to
its arguments, and one has to do an additional proof to show that the effects
in these systems actually correspond to an intended meaning.

Wadler and Thiemann showed the close relation between effect systems and
monads [@Wadler:marriage] and showed how any effect system can be translated
to a monadic version. For our particular system though a monadic translation
is quite involved due to polymorphic effects; essentially we need dependently
typed operations and we leave a proper monadic semantics for future work.
