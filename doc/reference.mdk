# Overview of Madoko { @h1=1 }

Madoko is a fast javascript [Markdown] processor written in [Koka]
It started out as a demo program for the new, strongly typed, [Koka] language and
the name comes from "_Ma_\/rk\/_do_\/wn in _Ko_\/ka".

Madoko can both be run local as a command-line program, or as a full
online experience on [Madoko.net] with storage and collaboration through [dropbox] or [github].

## Madoko philosophy

The main design goal of Madoko is to enable light-weight creation of 
high-quality scholarly[^scholarly] and industrial documents for the web and print,
while maintaining John Gruber's Markdown philosophy of simplicity and focus on
plain text readability.

The popularity of Markdown is not accidental, and it is great for writing
prose: it is super simple and straightforward to create good looking HTML
documents. But for more serious use Markdown falls short in several areas,
and Madoko provides many essential additions for larger documents:

* Extensive support for labeling and in-document [references][#sec-ids-labels].
* [Tables][#sec-table] with custom borders, column alignment, multicolumn spans, colors etc.
* Great [citation][#sec-bib] support, using standard BibTeX entries and styles.
* Great LaTeX integration where one can use any LaTeX style or package.
* Excellent support for static [syntax highlighting][#sec-pre] and transformation of code fragments.
* Automatic [numbering][#sec-numbering] of sections, figures, examples, etc. 
* Title page and [table-of-contents][#sec-special] generation.
* Support for user defined [custom blocks][#sec-custom], like `Theorem`, `Abstract`, `Figure`, etc.
* Styling for both HTML and LaTeX output through [standard CSS attributes][#sec-css]
  and [metadata rules][#sec-rules].
* Powerful document transformations through [replacement rules][#sec-replace].
* Excellent support for [advanced mathematics][#sec-math] and powerful packages like
    TikZ and PSTricks with hi-resolution images in web pages.
* Create great [presentations][#sec-presentations] for both the web and in print.
* Compatible with most common Markdown extensions, such as [footnotes][#sec-footnotes], 
    [mathematics][#sec-math], [attributes][#sec-attr], etc. 

Moreover the online editor [Madoko.net] supports:

* Full online editor, previewer, and document generator.
* Seamless sharing and collaboration with other authors through [dropbox] and [github]; 
  it is very easy to work together on a document where changes are
  continuously merged.
* Full support for mathematics and bibliographies through server-side LaTeX; 
  no need to install LaTeX yourself.

Instead of a plethora of backends, Madoko concentrates on generating either
HTML or high-quality PDF files through [LaTeX]. There has been a lot of effort
in Madoko to make the LaTeX generation robust and customizable while
integrating well with the various academic document- and bibliography styles.
This makes it great for writing articles using just Madoko and get both a
high-quality print format (PDF) and a great looking HTML page. Look at this
scientific article for an example:

## Performance and License

Madoko is a javascript program (written in [Koka]) that runs on [Node.js]. It is about 30% faster
then [Marked] \(one of the fastest Javascript markdown implementations), and
about 6 to 8 times faster than [Showdown] and [Markdown.js]. Madoko is also
available as a .NET executable on windows.

Madoko is free software available under the [Apache 2.0 license] at [madoko.codeplex.com].

# Installation and usage

The recommended way to use Madoko now is online on [Madoko.net] in
combination with [Dropbox] or [Github] to store your files and
collaborate and share with other users.

Nevertheless, Madoko works great as a command line tool as well, and it 
is good to have a solid backup. The easiest way to use Madoko is as a
command line tool is by using Node.js (which works on many platforms,
like Windows, MacOSX, Linux etc). Madoko can also run inside a web
browser or as a .NET executable. Installation under Node.js is very easy:

* Ensure you have [Node.js] installed on your system (and ensure that the
    Node installation directory is in your `PATH`).
* Open a command line window and run the Node package manager to install Madoko:\
  `npm install madoko -g`

and you are done. Translating a markdown document is done simply as:

* `madoko -v mydoc.mdk`

which generates `mydoc.html`. The `-v` flag gives more verbose output.
To also generate a PDF file, use:

* `madoko --pdf -vv --odir=out mydoc`

where `--odir` puts all output files in the `out` directory. To generate
a PDF, you need to have LaTeX installed on your system, which is also
required for mathematics and bibliographies. We recommend the
full [TeXLive] LaTeX system as it is available for Windows, Linux and
MacOSX, and is used on the [Madoko.net] server as well.

For PDF output, we added an extra verbose flag in order to see any warnings
LaTeX produces. A full description of all command line options can be found in
Appendix [#sec-commandline].

# Syntax: Inline elements

Madoko is fully compatible with basic [Markdown syntax][Markdown] and passes
the entire test suite. It also implements most extensions, like [Github
flavored markdown][GithubFM], [PanDoc], [Markdown Extra], and [multi-markdown][MultiMarkdown],
and it adds quite a few features itself to make it really useful for writing 
academic and industrial documents.

We assume that the reader is familiar with [basic markdown syntax][Markdown]. 

[Markdown Extra]:   http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra
[GitHubFM]:         https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown

In Madoko, _tab_'s are considered to be equivalent to 4 spaces. It is therefore 
best to configure your editor to view tabs as 4 spaces wide or documents may
look off.

## Emphasis

Enclose words in asterisks (`*`) or underscores (`_`) to emphasize them.
Use double asterisks or underscores for strong emphasis:

~ Sample
Here is _some emphasis_, or using *asterisks*.
Or use __strong emphasis__, or like **this**.
~

## Code

You can include pre-formatted text in regular text using back-quotes
(`` ` ``).

~ Sample
For emphasis, use the `<strong>` tag in HTML.
We can use back-quotes by using multiple ``back`quotes``. 
~

Section [#sec-pre] discusses code in more detail including syntax highlighting.

## Sub- and super-script

Using tilde (`~`) and hat (`^`), you can format inline text as sub- and super-script respectively.
Inside script, no white space is allowed to prevent mistakes. If you need white space you
can still use an escaped space (`\ `).

~ Sample
Here is how you write H~2~O or E=MC^2^.
Please use escapes for~longer\ script~.
~

## Strike-out

Enclose anything in two tildes and it will strike out the content:

~ Sample
There is a ~~strike out~~ here.
~

## Smart quotes, symbols, and direct links

Madoko will quote smartly using proper open and closing quotes for anything
enclosed in single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or French quotes (`<<`
and `>>`).

~ Sample
"double quoted"  
'single quoted'  
<<guillemot quoted>>  
<http://www.google.com>
~

Note that text enclosed in `<` and `>` brackets gets interpreted as direct 
link. Madoko will only smart quote single quotes if the last quote is not directly
followed by a letter. This often prevents wrong quotation with words like "can't":

~ Sample
'really, I can't do this', he said. 
I can't and mustn't do this.
~ 

Madoko will also replace multiple dashes and dots to a proper symbol:

~ Sample
Please distinguish a minus sign, -, from the _en dash_ which
is used to separate spans or pages, like 1--20, and the 
_em dash_ which is even longer and sometimes used for 
quotation attribution. --- Oscar Wilde.  
Three dots ... should be close together.
~

### Advanced: changing quotes

When replacing quotes, Madoko just inserts the right entity, like
an `&ldquo;` for a left double quote (&ldquo;). As described in Section [#sec-entity]
we can redefine entities, and use that to change the quotes. For example,
in some obscure countries, like the Netherlands, people like to start a 
quotation at &bdquo;the bottom&rdquo; instead. You can get this behavior
by adding the following [metadata][#sec-metadata] rule:

    ldquo: &bdquo;

Or Japanese style:

    lsquo: &#12300;
    rsquo: &#12301;
    ldquo: &#12302;
    rdquo: &#12303;

to single quote [&#12300;like this&#12301;]{tex-font-family="MS Gothic"}.

## Links  { #sec-links }

Madoko has three kinds of links, reference links, inline links, and direct
links. The inline links have the linked text between square brackets and the
URL follows between parenthesis, while direct links are simply enclosed
between angled brackets:

~ Sample
Here is a link to [Google](http://www.google.com). 
Or as a direct link: <http://www.google.com>.
~

Generally, reference links are preferred. Here, the link is defined separately
after the body of text such that it looks less cluttered:

~ Sample
Here is a link to [Google] again. 
We can also [Change the text][Google].

[Google]: http://www.google.com "Google"
~

Note how `[Google]` is simply a shorthand for `[Google][Google]`. The title in
double quotes in the link definition is optional. Link definitions do not
have to follow the text immediately and can be defined anywhere in the
document.

## Images      { #sec-image }

Images are included using a regular link prefixed with an exclamation mark (`!`).

~ Sample
A butterfly: ![bfly].

[bfly]: butterfly.png "A Monarch" { width=100px }
~

This example also shows the use of attributes (Section [#sec-attr]) where
we can specify the `width`, `height`, or `vertical-align` of the image.

~ MadokoNet
You can use to the toolbox menu to include images or just drag&drop
them directly into the editor. Just watch the file size as images
larger than about 1mb are rejected by the Madoko server.
~

## Footnotes  { #sec-footnotes }

Footnotes are written as regular link definitions prefixed with a hat (`^`)
character. This is the syntax [originally proposed][fnsyntax] by John Gruber.

~ Sample
Here is a footnote[^fn].

[^fn]: This is the content of the example footnote. 
    You can continue a footnote by indenting content.
    And notice the back link.
~

[fnsyntax]: http://daringfireball.net/2005/07/footnotes

## Escape sequences     { #sec-escapes }

If you want to use a special character directly without a special Markdown
meaning, precede it with a backslash (`\`). For example, to use a star (`*`)
without causing emphasis, you can write `\*`.  

Madoko will never escape a letter or digit and always keep the backslash, so
`\a` becomes "\\a" while `\&` becomes just "&". Thus, you can safely write
windows style file names without needing an escape:

~ Sample
Would you like c:\foo\bar to be deleted? Yes\No. 
Here are some other escapes: \\, \#, \*, \|, and \0.
~

This approach is different than that of Markdown which only escapes a specific
set of characters, while Madoko escapes everything that is not a letter or digit.
The advantage of the approach of Madoko is that this is easy to remember, while
trying to remember a specific set of special escape characters is near impossible.
This is similar to the [PanDoc] approach to escape sequences.

### Special escapes

Some characters are translated specially when escaped.
If you escape a space (`\ `), it is translated as a non-breakable space, while
a backslash at the end of a line causes a hard line break to be inserted. The 
latter is recommended over using the standard Markdown way of using two spaces
at the end of a line because it leaves visual clue that a line break occurs.

~ Sample
Here is non\ breakable space and a hard\
line break with a \* star.
~

Finally, the escape sequence `\/` translates to nothing; this can be very 
useful to separate certain constructs. For example, emphasis is suppressed
if the underscores appear inside a word, as in my_example_here. Using the
empty escape sequence we can emphasize inside words too: to get
my\/_example_\/here, we can simply write `my\/_example_\/here`.

# Syntax: Block elements

## Headings and rules { #sec-heading }

Headings are written by prefixing with one or more hash characters (`#`):

    # A level one heading
    ## A level two heading
    ### A level three heading
    ...
    ###### Up to level six

It is also possible to write level one and level two headers using
a line of three or more equal (`=`) or dash (`-`) characters:

    A level one heading
    ===================

    A level two heading
    -------------------

But hash-headings are generally preferred since a three or more  dashes (or
underscores or asterisks) are also used for horizontal rules:

~ Sample
Above...

------------

and below the line.
~ 


## Identities and labels {#sec-ids-labels}

Madoko has extensive support for numbering and referencing elements in a document.
Elements are given an identity using attributes (see Section [#sec-attr]).
For example, here we give an identifier `myheading` to a heading:

~ Sample
### A named heading { #myheading }

And we can refer to it

* Using an explicit [link](#myheading) 
    (or [reference][#myheading]).
* Or using an implicit link to Section [#myheading].
* Or we can just see its label, namely &myheading;.
~

Using an implicit link is generally recommended. 
When type setting a reference such as Section [#myheading], Madoko automatically
inserts a non-breakable space between "Section" and the reference[^refsp]. 
Unlike LaTeX there is no need to insert such non-breakable space yourself. 

[^refsp]: Madoko will still use a regular space if you use an explicit line 
    break between "Section" and the reference in the source.

Of course, we can refer to _any_ element that has an identity,
like equations, figures, tables, etc. Here is an example with an equation
(see Section [#sec-math]):

~~ Sample
In Equation [#euler] we define [Euler]'s number $e$: 

~ Equation { #euler }
e = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \right)^n
~

[Euler]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_number
~~

An implicit link such as `[#myheading]` is a shorthand for an explicit link of
the form `[&myheading;](#myheading)`, i.e. a local reference
to `#myheading` which displays the entity `&myheading;`. In Madoko, an entity
name like `&myheading;` is replaced by the _label_
value of the referred block (see Section [#sec-entity]). 
For headers, this is by default the header number
(as we will see in Section [#sec-numbering])  but you can set any label you'd
like. Using a minus\ (`-`) in the attributes clears all attributes, which is
used in the following example to suppress the default numbering:

~ Sample
### An unnumbered heading { - }
### A labeled heading     { - #myheading1 label="my label" }
Let's refer to Section [#myheading1].
~

Also, any local link, like "Section [#myheading]" or a citation like
"[@Goo93]", displays a tooltip when hovering above it. The tooltip content
is determined by the `caption` attribute of the target element.
For headings, this is by default the heading text.

~ MadokoNet
In the toolbox menu you can insert local references under
the `#` menu which shows all labels in the document.
~

## Figures and images { #sec-figure }

Figures can be included using the `Figure` custom block (see Section [#sec-custom]):
~~ SampleBlock
``` {language=madoko}
Figure [#fig-monarch] shows how to put an image in a figure.

~ Figure { #fig-monarch caption="A Monarch butterfly." }
The ![monarch] image.
~

[monarch]: butterfly.png {width=100px vertical-align=middle}
```
* * * { width=50% text-align=left }
~~~ SampleOutput
Figure [#fig-monarch] shows how to put an image in a figure.

~ Figure { #fig-monarch caption="A Monarch butterfly." }
The ![monarch] image.
~
[monarch]: butterfly.png { width=100px vertical-align=middle }

A figure can be given an identity and referred to just like headings.
The `caption` attribute gives the caption of the figure which is also
used in the table-of-figures. A `Figure` can have a `page-align`
attribute that can be set to `top`, `bottom`, `page`, `here` and
`forcehere`. This is ignored in the HTML output but used in LaTeX to
influence where a figure is placed on a page. The `.wide` attribute is
used in LaTeX to have figures span both columns in a two-column
document class.

## Lists  { #sec-lists }

Unordered lists are created simply by using an asterisks (`*`), plus (`+`),
or dash (`-`) as item markers preceded by an empty line (or otherwise
it is considered part of a paragraph):

~ Sample
Groceries:

* Banana
* Bread
    - white
    - whole grain
* Basil
~

Each item marker must be followed by a space.
You can created ordered lists using numbers followed by a dot and space. Also
long list items can be wrapped by indenting the text for each item:

~ Sample
1. An ordered list example. 
    With some longer items.
2. An another item
    with more text.
~

Normally, the content of each list item is just treated as text and not as a
paragraph. If there are any blank lines in the entire list, each item is 
typeset with a surrounding paragraph which makes the list a bit looser for
HTML output:

~ Sample
3. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
    Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. 

3. Vestibulum enim wisi,
    viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.

3. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum sit amet velit.
    Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.
~

Note how the specific numbers used in the list do not matter, except that
the first item determines the start number of the enumeration.

For ease of formatting, unordered lists get a class assigned corresponding
to their first bullet:

1. A bullet `*` gets class `list-star` (default display as &bull;).
2. A bullet `+` gets class `list-plus` (default display as &bbox;).
3. A bullet `-` gets class `list-dash` (default display as &ndash;).

This can be used in CSS or Latex to customize how the bullets 
are displayed.

## Definition lists { #sec-deflist }

Definition lists are used to define terms. Each term must fit on 
one line and is followed by one or more definitions. Each definition
starts with one or two spaces followed by a tiled (`~`) or colon (`:`).
Each definition must be indented by four spaces.

~ Sample
Abstract syntax
  ~ The conceptual structure (illustrated by the pictures) is called 
    the abstract syntax of the language.
Concrete syntax
  ~ The particular details and rules for writing expressions as strings 
    of characters is called the concrete syntax.
  ~ Perhaps some other meaning too?
~


## Block quotes { #sec-blockquote }

Block quotes are written just as in email using `>` angle brackets:

~ Sample
Let's start a block quote:
> Of life's two chief prizes, beauty and truth,
> I found the first in a loving heart and the 
> second in a laborer's hand.\
> &emsp;&emsp; --- Khalil Gibran
~

Just like lists, block quotes can be nested and contain other block elements.

## Columns: putting blocks next to each other

Using the `Columns` and `Column` custom blocks we can put block elements
next to each other on a page. Use the `width` attribute to control the
width of each column. Any columns without `width` are evenly divided over
the remaining space.

~ Begin Sample
~ Begin Columns
~ Column { width=40% }
Here is a long paragraph.
Here is a long paragraph.
Here is a long paragraph.
Here is a long paragraph.
Here is a long paragraph.
Here is a long paragraph.
Here is a long paragraph.
~
~ Column
A butterfly ![bfly]
~
~ Column { width=5em}
~~ Center
$e = mc^2$.
~~
~
~ End Columns
~ End Sample

## Code blocks  { #sec-pre }

You can write preformatted code simply by indenting the code with a tab
character or at least _four_ spaces. For example:

~ Sample
    <a href="foo.com">a link in html</a>
~

Another way to write code is to used _fenced_ code blocks. These start with at
least three backticks (`` ` ``) and goes on to the first line containing the
same number of backticks. Moreover, you can include the language name after
the backticks:

~ Sample
``` html 
<a href="foo.com">a link in html</a>
```
~

### Syntax highlighting

As we can see from the previous example, Madoko will automatically perform
(static) syntax highlighting for any code fragment that has the `language` key
set. For a fenced code block, Madoko automatically adds the `language` key
when the language is specified.

Internally, Madoko uses the Monarch library to do syntax highlighting.
This means that also the PDF output through LaTeX will be fully highlighted
(oh what a joy to no longer having to remember the vagaries of the `listing`
package). The standard library contains some default
language definition, like Java, JavaScript, C#, HTML, Ruby, and Python.

~ Sample
A Haskell keyword like `instance`{language=haskell} can be highlighted inline.
Or some Ruby code block:
``` Ruby
# ruby pi - how to calculate pi with ruby.
num = 4.0
pi = 0
plus = true
den = 1
while den < 10000000
  if plus 
    pi = pi + num/den 
    plus = false
  else
    pi = pi - num/den
    plus = true
  end
  den = den + 2
end

puts "PI = #{pi}"   # calculated value of pi
```
~

If you use a particular language a lot in your document, you may want
to set it as the default language using a metadata rule. For example:

    ~Pre,~Code: language=JavaScript

If you want to disable syntax highlighting for a particular code fragment,
you can set the language key to empty. To disable highlighting completely,
set the `Highlight` metadata key to `False`.

For HTML, it is also possible to use dynamic syntax highlighting with the
[Prettify][GPretty] library, see Appendix [#sec-gpretty] for more
information.

### Escaped code

Madoko allows you to escape back to inline madoko syntax inside code 
by bracketing inside `\(` and `\)`. This can be nice to insert
special looking symbols in the code while maintaining full automatic
syntax highlighting for all the surrounding code:

~ Sample
``` javascript
function sqr( x ) {
  var \(&pi;\) = 3.141593;
  return x*x  /* ensures \(_result_ $\ge$ 0\) on return.*/
}
```
~

This is especially powerful in combination with replace attributes (Section [#sec-replace]).
For example, in this document, we have the following metadata rules:
```{replace=clear .noescape}
~Pre,~Code: replace="/==>/\(&rArr;\)/g"
```

which makes it easy to insert an implication symbol in code:

~ Sample
Look at implication (1) in the following code:
```javascript   
function implies(x,y) { x ==> y }  \((**1**)\)
```
~

Each escaped piece of code is wrapped in a `code-escaped` element. 
This can be used to for example render all escaped text in a serif font:

    ~code-escaped: font-family=serif

Finally, you can use the `.noescape` class to suppress escaping.

When encountering a replaced piece of text, the syntax highlighter treats
it by default as whitespace. It is possible to specify though what characters
the syntax highlighter sees using the bar format: `\(`_highlight_`|`_replacement_`\)` 
where _highlight_ is used for the purpose of syntax highlighting (and alignment)
and _replacement_ is the replacement text in the output.
For example, to colorize our implication symbol as a keyword, we can do:

~ Sample
Look at highlighted implication (1) in the following code:
```javascript   
function implies(x,y) { x \(return|&rArr;\) y }  \((**1**)\)
```
~

### Advanced: Pretty code alignment

When writing high quality articles containing code fragments, it often
looks best when using a serif font instead of monospace. However, it becomes
hard to align the code properly in such cases. Madoko offers a special
`pretty` mode for advanced code alignment inspired by the excellent [lhs2tex]
tool by Andres  L&ouml;h.

~ Sample
We use a proportional font, but everything preceded by 2 or more spaces
is aligned properly:
``` Haskell { .pretty }
data Exp   =  Number    Int
           |  Add       Exp Exp
           |  Subtract  Exp Exp
           |  Multiply  Exp Exp
           |  Divide    Exp Exp
           |  Variable  String        -- added
           deriving (Eq)
```           
~

Even though the font used is proportional everything which is preceded by 
2 or more spaces is aligned. If something is indented more, there is some
default indentation being added. For example:

~ Sample
``` haskell { .pretty replace="/->/\(->|&rarr;\)/g" } 
substitute1  :: (String, Int) -> Exp -> Exp
substitute1  (var, val) exp = subst exp where
  subst (Number i)       =  Number i
  subst (Add a b)        =  Add (subst a) (subst b)
  subst (Subtract a b)   =  Subtract (subst a) (subst b)
  subst (Multiply a b)   =  Multiply (subst a) (subst b)
  subst (Divide a b)     =  Divide (subst a) (subst b)
  subst (Variable name)  =  if var == name
                             then Number val
                             else Variable name 
```                             
~ 

Note that we used a replacement expression to replace arrows with their
proper symbol. To make alignment and syntax highlighting work properly,
we used the bar format. In this case we wrote `\(->|` which makes the
replacement count for 2 characters for alignment purposes (and uses `->`
for the syntax highlighter). In LaTeX the samples generally align very
nice. Here is how the above example is rendered in LaTeX (where
we defined `\mdTokenPrettyType` to show a teal color):

![aligned]

Finally, for really pretty code, it generally helps to add more 
replacements. For example, here is a sample from the [lhs2tex] manual:

~ Sample
``` Haskell { .pretty \
              replace="//->/\(->|&rarr;\)//\\(?![()])/\(&lambda;\)//g" \
              replace="/_(?=[a-zA-Z])/\(_|&lowline;\)/g" \
              replace="/([a-zA-Z])(\d)\b/\(\1~\2~\)/g" }
rep_alg         =  (  \_          -> \m ->  Leaf m
                   ,  \lfun rfun  -> \m ->  let  lt = lfun m
                                                 rt = rfun m
                                            in Bin lt rt "hi"
                   )
replace_min t   =  (cata_tree rep_alg t) (cata_tree min_alg t)
```
~

In LaTeX this sample is rendered as:

![aligned2]

Note that to improve the rendering, we added replacements for underscores inside
identifiers with `&lowline;` and subscripted digits that end an identifier. Also,
we replaced right arrows and lambda bindings.

### Advanced: Customizing highlight colors

The syntax highlighter for a language assigns specific class names to each 
token. Using these classes we can customize how they are displayed. The
standard class names that are often used include:

`identifier`, `operators`, `keyword`, `string`, `escape`,
`comment`, `commentdoc`, `constant`, `entity`, `tag`, `info`, `warn`,
`error`, `debug`, `regexp`, `attribute`, `value`,
`constructor`, `namespace`, `header`, `type`, 
`predefined`, `invalid`, `code`, `codekeyword`, `typevar`, `delimiter`,
`number`, `variable`, `meta`, `bold`, and `italic`.

To customize the appearance in HTML, just use a CSS style declaration:

``` html
<style>
  .token.identifier    { font-style: italic }
  .token.string.escape { font-weight: bold }
</style>
```

In LaTeX, just define a `\mdToken`_token_ command. For example:

    ~ TexRaw
    \defcommand{\mdTokenIdentifier}[1]{\textit{#1}}
    \defcommand{\mdTokenEscape}[1]{\textbf{#1}}
    ~

We use `\defcommand` which is like `\newcommand` but doesn't fail if
the command was already defined.
For identifiers in _pretty_ code, the token rendering is determined 
by `mdTokenPretty`_token_ commands. By default, these tokens are not
colorized in LaTex but this is easy to customize:


    ~ TexRaw
    \defcommand{\mdTokenPrettyKeyword}[1]{\textcolor{blue}{\textsf{#1}}}
    ~


### Advanced: Custom syntax highlighting

Madoko can actually load syntax specifications dynamically to perform
syntax highlighting. For example, suppose you are a blogger that is writing
about the new Javascript module proposal, and you would like 
to highlight the new `module` or `export` keywords. 
Unfortunately, regular Javascript highlighting does no such thing:

``` JavaScript
// Javascript 5 modules
module Math {
  export function sum(x, y) {
    return x + y;
  } 
  export var pi = 3.141593;
}
```

In Madoko, you can add your own syntax highlighter quite easily. First, register 
your new language definition in the metadata:

    Colorizer: javascript
    Colorizer: javascript5

Because we are going to extend `javascript`, we also mention that language.
Now you need  a file `javascript5.json` which will contain the new language
definition as JSON:

``` javascript
{ "name": "javascript5",
  "extend": "javascript",
  "extraKeywords": ["module","export","import"]
}
```

This is generally all that is needed in most situations, but if you
like to get fancy, there is extensive [documentation][monarchdoc] about
writing syntax extensions. (or use `Colorizer: `_standard-language_ to
see the definitions of standard languages that come with Madoko (like
Javascript, Java, CSharp, Ruby, and Python).

[monarchdoc]: www.todo.com "Todo..." 

Et voil&agrave;, with our new language definition we can properly
highlight our previous example:

~ Sample
``` javascript5 
// Javascript 5 modules
module Math {
  export function sum(x, y) {
    return x + y;
  } 
  export var pi = 3.141593;
}
```
~

As an aside, note that colorization is done statically by Madoko, and not
dynamically when a user views your document (and therefore, it works
in LaTeX/PDF too).

There are many built-in languages in Madoko, and you can look
at their JSON definitions. Here are a few:
[Java](https://www.madoko.net/styles/lang/java.json),
[Dafny](https://www.madoko.net/styles/lang/dafny.json),
[C#](https://www.madoko.net/styles/lang/csharp.json),
[Javascript](https://www.madoko.net/styles/lang/javascript.json),
[HTML](https://www.madoko.net/styles/lang/html.json),
[LaTeX](https://www.madoko.net/styles/lang/latex.json), 
[BibTeX](https://www.madoko.net/styles/lang/bibtex.json), 
[Madoko](https://www.madoko.net/styles/lang/madoko.json),
[Python](https://www.madoko.net/styles/lang/python.json), 
[Ruby](https://www.madoko.net/styles/lang/ruby.json), 
[SMT](https://www.madoko.net/styles/lang/smt.json), 
[Koka](https://www.madoko.net/styles/lang/koka.json),
[C++](https://www.madoko.net/styles/lang/cpp.json),
etc. If you write your own JSON description, you can simply
include it yourself through the `Colorizer` metadata key.

### Advanced: taking over code blocks

It is possible to 'take over' code blocks and use them for
example for mathematics. For example, here is how to make
all code blocks use pre-formatted math (Section [#sec-mathpre]):

    ~Pre,~Code: input=mathpre

Moreover, you can selectively only take over different kinds
of code. Use `.code`_n_ for inline code with _n_ quotes, and 
`.pre-indented` or `pre-fenced` for indented or fenced code blocks.
For example, here is how to use a default language only for 
indented and double quoted (``` `` ```) code:

    .pre-indented,.code2: language=koka


## Tables { #sec-table }

Madoko significantly extends the table syntax of basic Markdown. In particular,
it is easy to add horizontal or vertical lines, to control cell alignment,
use multiple column spans, colorize rows, etc.
The basic rules for formatting a table are:

* Every line of the table should start and end with a `|` (or `+`) and columns are 
    separated by `|` (or `+`) too. If you need a `|` character in cell content, use 
    an escaped bar instead (`\|`).
* Every row can be on one line only, and there can be no blank lines.
* The table can optionally start with one or more _header_ rows.
* A cell can span multiple columns by using multiple bars to end the cell, like 
    `||` in the previous example.
* The table should always have a *column specifier* row that separates
    the header from the body of the table (or marks the start of the body in case
    there is no header). The content of each cell in the separator is just
    dashes (`-`) or tildes (`~`)


Here is an example of a plain table from "[Just a
Theory](http://www.justatheory.com/computers/markup/markdown-table-rfc.html)".
~ Sample
|  id  |    name    |      description           |  price  |
|:-----|:----------:|----------------------------|--------:|
| 1    |   gizmo    | Takes care of doohickies   |   1.99  |
| 2    |   doodad   |     Collects *gizmos*      |  23.80  |
| 10   |  dojigger  |            Foo             |  102.98 |
| 1024 | Self-explanatory, no?                  ||    0.99 |
~

The column specifier row is the second row in the previous example,
and it determines column alignment and vertical lines in a table:

* Columns can be aligned by using a `:` in a separator row column: one on the
    right or left aligns to the right or left, while a colon on both sides will
    center the column.
* If a column specifier uses a plus (`+`) instead of a bar (`|`) to separate
    the column, a vertical line is used to separate the columns. To distinguish
    the use of a `+` for a table instead of as a list item, there should be
    *no whitespace* following a `+` when used this way!
* If a column specifier cell uses dashes `-`, a horizontal line is drawn. By using
    tildes (`~`) instead, no line is drawn for that column specifier cell.  

In the next example, we suppress the horizontal line after the header, but add 
some vertical lines. Also, we use two header rows.
~ Sample
|    grouped       ||                            |         |
|  id  |    name    |      description           |  price  |
+:~~~~~|:~~~~~~~~~~:| ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ +~~~~~~~~:+
| 1    |   gizmo    | Takes care of doohickies   |   1.99  |
| 2    |   doodad   |     Collects *gizmos*      |  23.80  |
| 10   |  dojigger  |           Foo              |  102.98 |
| 1024 | Self-explanatory, no?                  ||    0.99 |
~

~ MadokoNet
You can press `Alt-Q` to reformat tables (or paragraphs) and align all columns.
Also, pressing `enter` in a table will add a new row (use `ctrl-enter` to 
use a regular line break if needed).
~

### Horizontal rules

We can draw horizontal rules in a table by using a row where
every cell just contains dashes (`-`). By using equal signs (`=`)
we get a double horizontal line. Here is a
a table with no header and an outer border:
~ Sample
+:----:|-------------+:--------------------------:|-------:+
| centered gizmos   || Takes care of doohickies   |  1.99  |
|   2  |    doodad   |    Collects *gizmos*       | 23.80  |
|  10  |   dojigger  |    Escaped \| and \+       | 102.98 |
| 1024 | thingamabob |  Self-explanatory, no?     |  0.99  |
|------|-------------|----------------------------|--------|
~

And finally a complex table with all kinds of alignment,  multiple column
spans and horizontal rules -- imagine trying to draw this example table in
HTML or LaTeX without consulting the manual.

~ Sample
| ------ | ----------------- | ------------------- | ------ |
|   id   |        name       |    description      |  price |
+--------+-------------------+:-------------------:+~~~~~~~:+
| 1      | gizmo                                          |||
|        | -----------------------------------------------|||
| 2      | doodad            | Collect *gizmos*    | 23.80  |
| ====== | ----------------- | =================== |--------|
| 1024   | thingamabob       | Self-explanatory    | 0.99   |
| ------ | ----------------- |                     | ------ |
~
Note how we started the previous table with a horizontal line, 
where the column specifier row is on the third line. 

### Long tables

If a table is expected to be long and cross multiple pages, the table should
be followed by an attribute declaration that sets the `.long` class. This is
used in LaTeX output to switch to a `longtable` environment which supports
tables that can be broken over multiple pages.

### The width of columns

We can specify the width (and other attributes) of a column by
adding an [attribute][#sec-attr] specification in the column
specification row. In the following example, we use a column
of fixed width, and one of a relative with with respect to 
the overall width of the table.

~ Sample
+:----:|---{width=2cm}--+:-----{width=60%}--------:+-------:+
| centered gizmos      || Take care of doo hickies |  1.99  |
|   2  |    doodad      |     Collects *gizmos*    | 23.80  |
|  10  |   dojigger     |            Foo           | 102.98 |
| 1024 | thingabob      |  Self-explanatory, no?   |  0.99  |
|------|----------------|--------------------------|--------|
~

### Colors 

Often we need to colorize certain rows or columns for clarity. 
Just like `width` we can specify a background color for a column
in the column specifier row.

Moreover, we can specify after the table more attributes that
can style the table further. In particular, any attribute can 
have the prefix `tr-` or `col-` to apply to rows or columns respectively.
Futhermore, `tbody-tr-` and `thead-tr-` only apply to body or head
rows. Moreover, you can follow the prefix with a modifier,
`even-`, `odd-`, `last-`, or _n_`-`, to apply  only to even, odd,
the last, or the _n_\/th row or column. Finally, the prefixes
`th-` and `td-` can be used for cell elements in the header or
body. The following example shows this in action:

~ Sample
| ---- | -------------- | ------------------------ | ------ |
|   id |     name       |    description           |  price |
+:----:+--{background-color=Silver}--+:-----------:|-------:+
| centered gizmos      || Take care of doo hickies |  1.99  |
|   2  |    doodad      |     Collects *gizmos*    | 23.80  |
|  10  |   dojigger     |            Foo           | 102.98 |
| 1024 | thingabob      |  Self-explanatory, no?   |  0.99  |
|------|----------------|--------------------------|--------|
{ tbody-tr-odd-background-color=Gainsboro \
  tr-even-background-color=Floralwhite }
~

Colors are standard CSS colors and can be specified as described
in Section [#sec-css].

### Book tables { #sec-booktable }

For producing high quality tables, there are some general guidelines that
need to be observed, in particular, it is considered good practice to:

1. Never use vertical rules in a table, and,
2. Never use double horizontal rules.

To make tables look good in this manner, we generally need rules
of varying thickness to distinguish the top rule, from the mid- and bottom 
rules in a table. By using the `.booktable` class, the rule widths 
and rule separation is set automatically. Here is an example from
the [Booktable] package documentation:

~ Sample
An example of a 'book table':

| --------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
|             Item             ||                 |
| \/------------- | ----------- |                 |
| Animal          | Description | &ensp;Price ($) |
| :-------------- | ----------- | --------------: |
| Gnat            | per gram    |           13.65 |
|                 | each        |            0.01 |
| Gnu             | stuffed     |           92.50 |

| Armadillo&ensp; | frozen      |            8.99 |
| --------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
{ .booktable }
~

Note how we used the empty escape sequence `\/` in front of 
the second dashed row in the header, or otherwise Madoko would interpret 
that row as the column specification row. The `.booktable` class 
ensures more vertical space between the rules, and a heavier top, mid-,
and bottom rule. The exact styling is specified using a (built-in) 
[metadata rule][#sec-rules] which is shown in Appendix [#app-custom].


[booktable]: http://mirror.hmc.edu/ctan/macros/latex/contrib/booktabs/booktabs.pdf

## Mathematics   { #sec-math }

Madoko documents can include mathematics in standard LaTeX syntax.
Generally, inline math should
be typeset between `$`\ characters, while block equations should use the 
`Equation` block syntax.

~~ Sample
A famous equation is $E = mc^2$, but another famous one is:
~ Equation  {#eq-gaussian}
 \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-a x^2} d x = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a}} 
~
and we can refer to Equation [#eq-gaussian] like any heading.
~~

Block equations can also be included use the `Math` custom block which
is just like the standard LaTeX display environment (using `$$` or
`\[`). However, the `Equation` block is preferred as it takes care of
numbering, and alignment. See also Section [#sec-custom] on custom
blocks that support mathematics, like `Theorem`, `Lemma`, `Proof`, etc.
Madoko does not support the `\(`, `\[`, and `$$` commands to enclose
mathematics since those are escape sequences in Madoko.

Sometimes inline equations between `$` signs can get quite long.
In Madoko you can use newlines and put a long inline formula on
multiple lines using LaTeX comments to end the line:
``` latex
A long $E = %continue on next line
   mc^2$ formula.
```
### Using packages

By default, Madoko supports most of the AMS mathematics commands,  i.e.
`amsmath`, `amsfonts`, and `amssymb`.  However, sometimes you need specific
packages. You can import more packages using the `Package` metadata key. For
example, we can include the [amscd]  package,

    Package: amscd

to draw commutative diagrams:

~~ Sample
~ Equation
\begin{CD}
S^{{\mathcal{W}}_\Lambda}\otimes T @>j>> T\\
@VVV @VV{P}V\\
(S\otimes T)/I @= (Z \otimes T)/J
\end{CD}
~
~~
As a hint to understand the previous example, note that `@VVV` denotes a downward arrow,
`@>j>>` a right pointing arrow with a label `j` on top, and `@=` a long equality.

Here is an example of the more modern [xypic] package which we included in this
document with the `curve` option:

    Package: [curve]xypic

With this package, we can draw more complex diagrams.

~~ Sample
~ Equation 
\xymatrix @-0.5em{
U \ar@/_/[ddr]_y \ar@/^/[drr]^x
\ar@{.>}[dr]|-{(x,y)} \\
& X \times_Z Y \ar[d]^q \ar[r]_p
& X \ar[d]_f \\
& Y \ar[r]^g & Z } 
~
~~

As a hint to understand the above code, note that `\ar@/_/[ddr]_y` denotes an arrow,
left curved (`@/_/`), going down, down, right (`[ddr]`), with a label `y`
underneath. See the package [user guide][xypic] for more examples.

~ MadokoNet
You can by default include any package included in [TexLive] (which are many).
If you need to include a local package (or document class, bibliography etc)
you can either use the toolbox menu or just drag&drop it into the editor.
~

### Math commands   { #sec-mathdefs }

For math-heavy documents, it is convenient to define LaTeX commands for 
common operations. Such command definitions can be directly understood by LaTeX
but need to be handled specially if the math is rendered dynamically in a HTML page. 
Madoko defines the custom block `MathDefs` to support mathematics definitions 
transparently across modes:

~~ Sample
~ MathDefs
\newcommand{\infer}[3]{#1 \vdash #2\,:#3}
~ 
We infer $\infer{\Gamma}{e}{\tau}$ for such expression $e$.
~~

Often it is convenient to put all such definitions in a separate `.tex` file and
include it in the document as:

    ~ MathDefs
    [INCLUDE="mathdefs.tex"]
    ~

### Mathematics in HTML

To typeset mathematics in HTML, Madoko can either typeset the math
statically or dynamically:

* `static`: In the default static mode, Madoko uses LaTeX to generate static images 
    for each formula. This is generally preferred because pages load fast, 
    and it requires no javascript. The drawback is that you
    need to have LaTeX installed on your system. See the 
    [metadata section][#item-math]
    for more information on fine-tuning static mathematics.

* `dynamic`:  Madoko uses the [MathJax] JavaScript
    library to render the math on the client-side. This means you do not
    need LaTeX but it is generally quite slow for math-heavy documents and
    not all of the LaTeX commands and packages are available. This mode can be
    enabled in the metadata as:
    ```
    Math Mode: dynamic
    ```
    The [metadata section][#item-math] contains more information on customizing MathJax.

You can view and experiment with the different rendering modes in the online
[mathematics rendering demo][mathdemo].

[mathdemopdf]: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/daan/madoko/samples/mathdemo/out/mathdemo.pdf


### Advanced: Generic LaTeX snippets { #sec-snippets }

Besides just mathematics, you can include arbitrary LaTeX snippets using the
custom `Snippet` block.  In static math mode such snippets get included in the
web page as hi-res images. This makes it possible to use powerful packages
like [TikZ] and [PSTricks]. To extract the images, Madoko uses [ImageMagick's
Convert][convert] program that  should be installed on your system ([download][convert]).

[convert]: http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php

For the following example, we use PSTricks:
```
Package: pstricks
Package: pst-plot
```
to typeset a the graph of the natural logarithm[^ex-log]:
~ Begin Sample
~ Center  {padding=1ex} 
~~ Snippet
\psset{unit=2cm} 
\begin{pspicture*}(-0.5,-1.5)(4,2)
  \psgrid[subgriddiv=5,gridcolor=black!20%
         ,gridlabels=0pt](1,0)(3,1.2)
  \psaxes{->}(0,0)(0,-1)(3.2,1.5)
  \uput[0](3.2,0){$x$}\uput[90](0,1.5){$f(x)$}
  \pscircle*[linecolor=red](! Euler 1){3pt}
  \psline[linecolor=red,linestyle=dashed]%
         (! Euler 0)(! Euler 1)
  \psline[linecolor=red,linewidth=0.2pt,arrowscale=2]%
         {->}(! Euler 1)(0, 1)
  \uput[-90](! Euler 0){\color{red}$e$}
  \pscircle*[linecolor=blue](1,0){3pt}
  \psplot[linewidth=1pt]{0.2}{3}{ x ln }
  \rput(1.6,-0.5){\color{blue}\fbox{$f(x)=\ln(x)$}} 
\end{pspicture*}

### Advanced: Efficiency of math rendering  { #sec-mathefficiency }

Madoko is quite optimized to render mathematics efficiently, especially
for math heavy documents which can easily contain thousands of small 
mathematics fragments. Madoko carefully processes only those fragments
that need recompilation. If needed you can give the `-r` flag to rebuild
everything from scratch. 

Usually, Madoko uses plain `latex` to generate a `.dvi` file, and then
uses `dvipng` to extract hi-resolution images, automatically taking care
of proper baseline alignment. 

However, certain snippets cannot work with plain `.dvi` and need postscript
or PDF primitives, like the TikZ and PSTricks packages. In such cases,
Madoko will render these snippets using `xelatex` to generate a `.pdf`
file, and [ImageMagick's Convert][convert] program to extract images. However, this
is not done by default since this method is much (much!) slower than extracting
from the `.dvi` file. The `.pdf` method is done automatically for any `Snippet`.
You can force a `Snippet` to use the `dvi` method by setting `snippet-needpdf=false`
in its attributes, and dually, you can force the `pdf` method for any
equation by setting `math-needpdf=true`.

### Advanced: Preformatted math   { #sec-mathpre }

LaTeX math mode is great for regular mathematics but not so good if one tries
to preserve whitespace or uses longer identifiers. This is actually quite common
for computer science documents where mathematics is mixed with program code.
Madoko supports a `MathPre` custom block that makes _preformatted_ math much
easier to typeset. In particular:

* Whitespace is preserved and spaces are replaced with a medium space (`\mathspace`) command
    (except when the spaces directly follow a LaTeX command). Indentation is done through
    a `\mathindent` command, while line breaks are automatic with a `\mathbr` command.

* A name (consisting of letters and digits) is typeset in a `\mathid` command so 
    it will look like $\mathit{function}$ instead of $function$ (note the spacing
    between the $f$ and $u$ for example).

* If a name ends with digits, they are typeset as subscripts, where `x1` becomes $\mathit{x}_1$.

* A name starting with an `@` character is typeset using a `\mathkw` command, where
    `@return` becomes $\mathkw{return}$.

* Any text that is an argument of a `\begin`, `\end`, `\text`_xx_ or
    `\math`_xx_ command,      where _xx_ is one of `tt`, `sf`, `sl`, `rm`, `it`,
    `kw`, `id`, `bb`, or `bf`, is kept unchanged. Also any name starting with
    a `#` character is kept unchanged.

* Ampersands can be used to align text.

Using this convention, we can easily typeset program code using nice symbols.

~~ Sample
~ MathPre
@function sqr_\pi( num :int ) \{
   @return (num {\times} num \times{} \pi)
\} 
~
~~ 

Here is an example of aligned text which also demonstrates the use of `replace` (see 
Section [#sec-replace]):

~~ Sample
~ MathPre   { replace="/->/\rightarrow/g" }
random &: () -> ndet double;
print  &: string -> io ();
error  &: \forall\langle\alpha\rangle\ string -> exn \alpha; 
~
~~

Of course, you can often achieve a similar effect by using good
replacers with `.pretty` code directly (Section [#sec-advanced--pretty-code-alignment]):

~~ Sample
``` koka   { .pretty \
             replace="//->/\(->|&rarr;\)//</\(<|&lang;\)//>/\(>|&rang;\)//g" \
             replace="//\bforall\b/\(forall|&forall;\)//\balpha\b/\(alpha|&alpha;\)//g" }
random  : () -> ndet double; 
print   : string -> io ();
error   : forall<alpha> string -> exn alpha;
```
~~

### Setting all code to preformatted math

If you want to typeset all math using preformatted math, you can actually 'take over'
the standard math blocks in Madoko and set the input of those to `mathpre`. 
For example:

    .Math-Inline,.Math-Display: input=mathpre 

These set both display- and inline-math to the `mathpre` input mode.


## Table of contents  { #sec-toc }

Generating a table of contents is easy, just include the special element
`[TOC]` anywhere in your document and it will expand to a table of contents.
You an use the metadata value `Toc Depth` to set how many levels deep the
table of contents goes (by default 3).

You can also a create a list of figures, by using `[TOC=tof]`. This will list
all the `~Figure` block elements.

### Advanced: Custom tables of contents

Custom tables of contents can be generated using the `toc` attribute.  The
`toc-depth` attribute specifies the depth of the element (by default 1), while
the `toc-line` specifies the contents of the line displayed in the table of
contents. For example, using [metadata rules][#sec-rules] we can generate a
table of contents for equations:

    ~Equation: toc=equations toc-line="&caption;"

Here we assume that the user adds a `caption` attribute when denoting
equations (which will get expanded inside the `toc-line`). We can then render
the table of equations anywhere in the document as:

    [TOC=equations]

## Bibliography and Citations       { #sec-bib }

One of Madoko's main design goals is to enable the creation of high-quality
scholarly articles. As such, Madoko integrates closely with the standard 
[BibTeX] tool to generate bibliographies and references inside a document.
Usually, BibTeX comes standard with any LaTeX installation.

You can simply use any existing BibTeX bibliography file (`.bib`). You can
specify which bibliography files are to be used using  `Bib` 
[metadata](#sec-metadata) entries:

    Bib:  ../mybib1
    Bib:  mybib2
 
As an example, you can view the bibliography for this document [here](reference.bib).
Entries in the bibliography files can now be referenced using semi-colon separated 
references (as in [Pandoc]), for example 

~ Sample
Read about LaTeX and TeX [@Knuth:Tex; @Lamport:Latex].
~

Note that unlike LaTeX there is no need to explicitly insert an unbreakable
space between the text and the citation, Madoko automatically takes care of this
(as described in Section [#sec-ids-labels]).
If necessary, you can also include extra text for each entry:

~ Sample
Read more [The book @Knuth:Tex;\ @Lamport:Latex (chapter 4)]. 
~

When Madoko finds such references, it writes them to a `.bib.aux` file
(together with the needed bibliography files) that are read by BibTeX to
generate the bibliography entries. BibTeX is called automatically by Madoko
whenever the citations change. The generated bibliography entries are included
in your document using the special `[BIB]` element, for example:

    ## References   {-}
    [BIB]

which you can see at the [end of this document][#sec-references].

### Bibliography styles  { #sec-bibstyle }

The style of the bibliography entries is determined using the `Bib Style` key
and can be any [BibTeX style](http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/bibtexstyles.html)
(by default `plainnat`):

    Bib Style: abbrvnat

Madoko uses a very simple LaTeX parser to format the bibliography entries in
Markdown. It can handle things like special characters and accents quite well
and recognizes many formatting commands. Even though it is sufficient for
bibliography entries in general, the Madoko LaTeX parser may not work for more
fancy LaTeX commands in bibliography entries. However, we strive to make it
work for any bibliography style and entries, so please [file a bug report][issues] 
if you encounter situations where it does not work correctly.

Bibliography styles tested with Madoko include the following author-year
styles: `apa`, `apalike`, `plainnat`, `abbrvnat`, `unsrtnat`, `newapa`,
`chicago`, `named`,  `agsm`, `dcu`, `kluwer`, `astron`, `bbs`, `cbe`,
`humannat`, `humanbio`, `jtb`, `apsrev4-1`, `aipauth4-1` and others. 
Also, the following numeric styles
have been tested: `eptcs`,  `abbrv`, `plain`, `ieeetr`, `acm`, `unsrt`,
`alpha`, `siam`, `apsrmp4-1`, `aipnum4-1` and others.
Since tools like BibTeX and Madoko make numbering and linking automatic,  it
is generally preferred for modern documents to use a numeric citations style.

[bibtex]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX
[issues]: http://madoko.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic


### Citation styles   { #sec-cite }

The citation style defaults to a _numeric_ style. However, it can be set
explicitly using the `Cite Style` metadata key:

    Cite Style: natural

Valid citation styles are _natural_, _textual_, _super_,
and _numeric_ (default). The natural and textual style use author-year style
citations, while the super and numeric styles use numbers.

| ~~~~~~~~~~~ | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ |
| _natural_   | [@Lamport:Latex;@Knuth:Tex]{cite-style=natural}  | (default for author-year citations) |
| _textual_   | [@Lamport:Latex;@Knuth:Tex]{cite-style=textual}  |                                     |
| _numeric_   | [@Lamport:Latex;@Knuth:Tex]{cite-style=numeric}  | (default for numeric citations)     |
| _super_     | [@Lamport:Latex;@Knuth:Tex]{cite-style=super}    |                                     |

Note that numeric citations are sorted (and compressed) by default.
Also full author-year style citations only work with BibTeX styles that
support this, i.e. generally any style that works with the `natbib` package
like `plainnat`. With author-year citations we can use modifiers to change how 
the citation is shown. For example, assuming a _natural_ style:

| ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ |
| `[@Goo93]`                    | [@Goo93]{cite-style=natural}          | Natural                         |
| `[+@Goo93]`                   | [+@Goo93]{cite-style=natural}         | Long -- all authors             |
| `[-@Goo93]`                   | [-@Goo93]{cite-style=natural}         | Short -- just year              |

Moreover, if you leave out the brackets, you force a _textual_ style:

| ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ |
| `@Goo93`                      | [@Goo93]{cite-style=natural .textual}  | Textual style                   |
| `+@Goo93`                     | [+@Goo93]{cite-style=natural .textual} | Long -- all authors             |
| `-@Goo93`                     | [-@Goo93]{cite-style=natural .textual} | Short -- just year              |
| `!@Goo93`                     | [!@Goo93]{cite-style=natural .textual} | Just authors                    |

In a numeric style, most of these attributes have no effect and all the 
bracketed cases are displayed as "[@Goo93]". 
For the four cases in textual style, we get  "@Goo93", "+@Goo93", "-@Goo93", and "!@Goo93".

See Appendix [#sec-custom-cite] on how to customize citations styles further,
and Appendix [#sec-custom-bib] on how to write your bibliography entries
by hand without using BibTeX.

### Bibliography tooltips and searches

By default, the HTML backend shows a tooltip when hovering over  a citation
(try it [@Goo93]). This functionality is by default disabled in the LaTeX
backend. However, you can enable tooltips in PDF too by setting the
`.tex-tooltip` class through a metadata rule:

    ~a: .tex-tooltip

This will display a small yellow text balloon in the PDF file that shows a
tooltip when hovering above it:

~ Center
![tooltip].
~

[tooltip]: tooltip.png "A citation tooltip in PDF" { width=300px }

Moreover, Madoko adds to each bibliography entry a magnifying glass icon 
([&mglass;](http://www.google.com/search?q=Goossens+Mittelbach+Samarin+Latex+Companion){.bibsearch}) 
that links to a web search for that reference. You can customize the search 
engine that is used by setting the `Bib Search Url` metadata key:

    Bib Search Url: www.google.com

If you set the `Bib Search Url` to `false` (or empty), Madoko will disable search icons.
Again, this functionality is disabled by default in the LaTeX backend unless you 
set the `Bib Search Url` key explicitly

## Custom blocks    { #sec-custom }

Madoko custom blocks are similar to the `div` element in HTML and allow the
use of custom block elements that can be styled and processed in a particular
way. A custom block starts on new line starting with one or more tildes (`~`)
optionally followed by the block name and attributes. It ends at _the first
line containing the same number of tildes_ that started this block.

~~~ Sample
~ Note           
Here is a note.
~
~~  { font-style=italic }
And some italic text in an unnamed block.
~~
~~~ 

Note that blocks with the same number of tildes do not nest, e.g. the following 
is wrong:

    ~ Note
    ~ Equation
    e = mc^2
    ~
    ~

since the `Note` will end at the first lonely tilde, not the second one.
As an aside, [git flavored markdown][gitmd] uses three or more tildes for fenced
code blocks. Since Madoko uses tildes for custom code blocks this cannot be
used and Madoko only supports the more popular back-ticks (```` ``` ````)
for fenced code blocks.

[gitmd]: https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown

Custom blocks work especially well with metadata rules (see Section [#sec-rules])
where we can define attributes that get applied to every occurrence of a 
custom block. For example, we could define the metadata rule:

    ~Slanted:  font-style=oblique 

and then every occurrence of a `Slanted` custom block would be typeset in a
slanted font.
~~ Sample
~ Slanted
Here is my slanted custom block
~
~~

The "number-of-tildes" rule to delimit custom blocks is convenient and works
fine  when nesting a small number of custom blocks, but for long  blocks or
deep nesting, this can easily lead to confusion. To alleviate this, a custom
block can also start with one or more tildes, followed by `Begin` _blockname_.
Such block continues until a corresponding number of tildes is found followed
by `End` _blockname_.  It is recommended to use this form of blocks for
example in  [metadata rules][#sec-rules]

~~ Sample
~ Begin Slanted
~ Begin Note
Here is a slanted note.
~ End Note
~ End Slanted
~~

### Predefined custom blocks  { #sec-predef-custom }

Madoko defines quite a few common custom blocks. Their exact 
definitions can be found in Appendix [#app-custom]. 

* `Figure`: This is used to define figures (see Section [#sec-figure]). 
    Recognizes the following attributes:
    - `caption=`_caption_: specify the caption of a figure.
    - `.wide`: if the class `wide` is set, the figure will span the width of a page 
        in a two-column format (used in LaTeX).
    - `page-align=`(`top`|`bottom`|`page`|`here`|`forcehere`): specify the alignment of the figure in a page 
        (used for LaTeX output).

* `Equation`: Specify mathematical equations. See Section [#sec-math] for its usage.

* `Snippet`: Generic LaTeX snippets, see Section [#sec-snippets].

* `Bibitem`, `Bibliography`: Used for writing bibliography entries by hand. See Section [#sec-bib] 
    for more information.
* `Note`, `Remark`, `Proof`: Used for notes, remarks, and proofs.
* `Abstract`: Defines the abstract of an article.
* `Framed`: A block with a solid border. Use the `tight` attribute to suppress a paragraph
    block around its content.
* `Center`: A block that centers its contents horizontally on the page. 
* `Columns`, `Column`: Put `Column` blocks inside a `Columns` block, to typeset block elements
    next to each other on a page. Use the `width` attribute to control the width of each
    column.
* `TexRaw`: A block for raw TeX content that is passed directly to LaTeX.
* `Section`: Starts an explicit section. In the HTML5 backend expands to a `<section>` element.
    This is mainly used inside presentations using `reveal.js`. 
* `Article`, `Aside`, `Nav`: Expand to the corresponding HTML5 elements.
* `HtmlRaw`: A block with raw HTML content that is pasted directly into
  the HTML output. This is normally not needed since you can just start
  including HTML elements directly as part of markdown input.
* `TexOnly`: A markdown block that is only processed for LaTeX output (and not shown in HTML output).
* `HtmlOnly`: A markdown block that is only processed for Html output (and not shown in LaTeX output).
* `MathPre`: A block with preformatted math (Section [#sec-mathpre]).
* `MathDefs`: A block with LaTeX math definitions (Section [#sec-mathdefs]).
*   `Theorem`, `Lemma`, `Proposition`, `Corollary`, `Example`, `Definition`: Each of these blocks
    is individually numbered and starts with the block name in bold. For example:
    ~~ Sample
    ~ Lemma     {#LeftCosetsDisjoint}
    Let $H$ be a subgroup of a group $G$, and let $x$ and 
    $y$ be elements of $G$.  Suppose that $xH \cap yH$ is 
    non-empty. Then $xH = yH$.
    ~
    ~ Proof
    Let $z$ be some element of $xH \cap yH$.  Then $z = xa$
    for some $a \in H$, and $z = yb$ for some $b \in H$.
    If $h$ is any element of $H$ then $ah \in H$ and
    $a^{-1}h \in H$, since $H$ is a subgroup of $G$.
    But $zh = x(ah)$ and $xh = z(a^{-1}h)$ for all 
    $h \in H$.
    Therefore $zH \subset xH$ and $xH \subset zH$, and thus
    $xH = zH$.  Similarly $yH = zH$, and thus $xH = yH$,
    as required. This concludes the proof of 
    Lemma [#LeftCosetsDisjoint]. &qed;
    ~
    ~~ 
Of course, each of the predefined blocks can be customized further using attributes and rules.
For example, by including the following metadata rule, we can typeset proofs with _Proof_ in
an italic style instead of bold:
```
~Proof: before="[_Proof_. ]{.proof-before}"
```

## Special block elements { #sec-special }

Madoko supports some special block elements that get expanded automatically.

* `[TITLE]`: Expands to a title element generated from the [metadata][#sec-metadata] 
    keys _title_,
    _subtitle_, _title date_ and author info (_author_, _affiliation_, and _email_).
    In the LaTeX backend this will invoke the `\maketitle` command.

* `[TOC]`, `[TOC=`_name_`]`: Expands to a table of contents. See also Section [#sec-toc].

* `[FOOTNOTES]`: Expands to the defined footnotes. If there are footnotes and this element
    is not present, the footnotes are automatically included at the end of the document.
    In the LaTeX backend, footnotes always appear at page footers.

* `[INCLUDE=`_file_`]`: Expands to the contents of _file_. Include elements are
    processed before any other processing happens and can for example be used to
    include meta data elements.
    ```
    [INCLUDE="presentation"]
    ```
    Include files are first searched relative to the current directory, then
    the directory of the input file, followed by the output directory, and finally
    the `styles` directory in the installation directory of Madoko. The default
    file extension is `.mdk`.
    
    The `INCLUDE` element can also be used to include parts of a file,
    see Section [#sec-includefrag] for more information.
    
* `[BIB]`: Includes the bibliography entry file (`.bbl`) generated by BibTex. Internally
    expands to:
    ```
    ~ Begin TeX 
    [INCLUDE="myfile.bbl"]      
    ~ End TeX   
    ```
    See also Section [#sec-bib].

### Advanced: including file fragments  { #sec-includefrag } 

The full syntax of the `INCLUDE` element is:

`[INCLUDE`(`=`_file_)?(`:`_range_)?`]`

where the _range_ is either a _fragment name_ or line range. For
example we can include part of file by using:

    [INCLUDE=foo.hs:10-18]

or

    [INCLUDE=foo.hs:20]

which would include lines 10 to 18 and just line 20 from `foo.hs`. 
Of course remembering line ranges can be error prone, so we can also
give names to fragments of files and use those to refer to them.
For example, we may have code samples in `foo.hs` as:

``` haskell
-- BEGIN:Var
-- BEGIN:Syntax
data Exp  =  Number     Int
          |  Add        Exp Exp
          |  Subtract   Exp Exp
          |  Multiply   Exp Exp
          |  Divide     Exp Exp
-- END:Syntax
          |  Variable   String;
-- END:Var                     

--BEGIN:Eval
evaluate :: Exp -> Int
evaluate (Number i)      = i
evaluate (Add a b)       = evaluate a + evaluate b
evaluate (Subtract a b)  = evaluate a - evaluate b
evaluate (Multiply a b)  = evaluate a * evaluate b
evaluate (Divide a b)    = evaluate a `div` evaluate b
--END:Eval
```

Where the `BEGIN `_name_ and `END `_name_ delimit file fragments. Note that
the fragments can be nested. We can now include particular fragments as:

    [INCLUDE=foo.hs:Var]
    [INCLUDE=foo.hs:Eval]

for example. Sometimes, it can be a hassle to always mention the full
file name. In that case, we can first do a few empty includes of all
the needed files (so Madoko knows the fragment names), and then just use
the fragment names directly, e.g. first an empty include at the start of
the document by using line number 0:

    [INCLUDE=foo.hs:0]

and later in the document, we can refer to fragments in that file using:

    [INCLUDE:Syntax]

The delimiters for fragments are always '_start_ `BEGIN`|`END` _name_' where
_start_ includes most of the usual comment characters, namely,
`//`, `--`, `#`, and `%`. If you need some other sequence, you can
customize this using the `Fragment Start` and `Fragment End` metadata keys.
For example, the default is set as:

    Fragment Start: ^(?:\/\/|--|[#%]) *BEGIN *: *(\w+) *$
    Fragment End  : ^(?:\/\/|--|[#%]) *END *(?:[:] *(\w+) *)?$


# Syntax: Metadata and Styling

## Metadata         { #sec-metadata }

Similar to [multimarkdown], a document can begin with a special metadata
section that contains meta information like the document title, the author,
etc. Moreover, this section can contain attribute rules to globally apply
attributes to certain elements, much like CSS rules.

Metadata must come immediately as the first thing in a document, and consists
of keys followed by a colon and then the key value. A key value can span 
multiple lines by indenting, and you can leave blank lines between different keys.

    Title       : An overview of Madoko
    Author      : Daan Leijen
    Affiliation : Microsoft Research
    Email       : daan@microsoft.com
    Heading Base: 2
    Logo        : False
    Embed       : False

In general, metadata keys are not case-sensitive. The values
`none`, `clear`, `false`, and the empty value are all equivalent for
boolean or numeric keys. 

### Special metadata keys

Any metadata key and value can be given (and referred to using 
[entity names][#sec-entity]),  but certain keys have special meaning to Madoko.

* `Title`: The title of the document. For example, in HTML output it
    determines the `<title>` element. It is also used by the special `[TITLE]`
    element (Section [#sec-special]).

* `Subtitle`: An optional subtitle.

* `Title Note`: A general note about the document. Used in the `[TITLE]`
    element where it is put below the title and authors. 
    ```
    Title Note: Draft, &date; (version 1.0)
    ```

* `Author`, `Address`, `Affiliation`, `Email`, `Author Note`: the author
    name, address, affiliation, email, and general note. There can be
    multiple authors. The author info is also used by the `[TITLE]`
    element to generate a proper document title header. The authors are
    also written to the author `<meta>` tag. In the case of multiple
    authors, the address, affiliation, author note, and email always
    belong to the last defined author. If you define multiple 
    `Address` or `Affiliation` entries for one author, they are placed
    above each other.

* `Author Columns` (=3): The number of columns used for the authors.
    Only relevant if there are more than 3 authors used. 

* `Toc depth` (=3): The maximum depth of headings that are included in the
    table of contents (Section [#sec-toc]). 

* `Heading depth` (=3): The maximum depth of headings that are numbered (Section [#sec-numbering]).
    Set it to zero to suppress numbering of headings completely.

* `Heading base` (=1): Usually, a top heading (`# heading`) maps to a `<h1>` or
    `\chapter` element in HTML and LaTeX respectively. By increasing the `Heading Base` you
    can change this mapping. For example, by using:
    ```
    Heading Base: 2
    ```
    the top headings will map to `<h2>` or `\section` elements instead.

* `Section Depth` (=0): Maximal heading level where `<section>` elements are wrapped
    around the content. The default value ensures no section wrapping takes place.

* `Section Base` (=1): All headings at `Section Base` and lower are treated
    as equal for the purpose of wrapping `<section>` elements around the content.
    This is especially useful for presentations where we would like to start
    slides equally for headings at level 1 and 2 (see Appendix [#sec-presentations]).

* `Bib` or `Bibliography`: Specify a bibliography (`.bib`) file to be used by
    the BibTeX tool to generate a list of references (see Section [#sec-bib]).
    ```
    Bib: ../mybibliography.bib
    ``` 
* `Bib Style` or `Biblio Style` (=plain): Specify a BibTeX style that is used to format the list of 
    references. See Section [#sec-bibstyle] for more information.
    ```
    Bib Style: plainnat
    ```
* `Cite Style` (=numeric): Specify the citation style used for citations,
    _natural_, _textual, _super_, or _numeric_. See Section [#sec-cite] for more 
    information.

* `Cite All` (=false): Set to `True` to cite everything in the included bibliography files.

* `BibTex` (=bibtex): The command to run the BibTeX tool. Set it to `false` to suppress
    running BibTeX (for example, where writing bibliography entries by hand 
    (see Section [#sec-custom-bib]))

* `Pdf Latex` (=`xelatex`): The command used to run the LaTeX program when the `--pdf`
    command line flag is present. 

* `Fragment Start`, `Fragment End`: Used to specify file fragment delimiters,
    see Section [#sec-includefrag].

* `Logo` (=`True`): Set to `False` to suppress the "Document generated by Madoko.net"
    message at the end of the document.
    
* `Refer`: Make explicit that a certain file or image is referenced by this document.
   ~ MadokoNet
   This is useful in the online editor if the inclusion of the file is not apparent
   to Madoko. This can happen for example in LaTeX class files that reference images,
   or image references inside HTML attributes.
   ~    

The following keys are not used as this moment but have a standard meaning:

* `Copyright`: Copyright information. Written to the copyright `<meta>` tag.
* `License`: License for this document. Written to the license `<meta>` tag.
* `Keywords`: A list of document keywords. Written to the keywords `<meta>` tag.
* `Description`: A short description of the document. Written to the description `<meta>` tag.
* `Comment`: General comments.
* `Revision`: Revision of the document.
* `Phone`: Phone number of an author.

### HTML keys

Some keys are only interpreted for HTML output:

* `Css`: Specify a CSS file that needs to be included in HTML output. There can
    be many CSS keys present.
    ```
    Css: lib/main.css
    Css: http://foo.com/bar.css
    Css: http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans
    ```
    Use `Css: clear` to clear the list of CSS files. This can be used for example
    to not include the default `madoko.css` style file.
    
    ~ MadokoNet
    When not giving an extension or full path, Madoko will try to load
    the css file from the Madoko server's `/style` directory. 
    This is used for the standard `madoko.css` file. 
    ~

* `Script`: Specify a Javascript file that needs to be included in the HTML output
    via a `<script>` tag. There can be many script keys present.
    ```
    Script: lib/main.js
    ```
    ~ MadokoNet 
    Usually, scripts are _not_ loaded in the preview as this may lead
    to performance problems. You can use the `preview` class to signify
    that the script should be loaded in the preview too:
    ```
    Script: reveal.js {.preview}
    ```
    ~

* `Embed` (=`512`): The file size limit in kilobytes up to which local data is directly
    embedded into the HTML, this includes CSS style files, Javascript files, and images.
    Set it to `0` to never embed anything, and high enough to always embed.

* `HTML Meta`: Specify content included in a `<meta>` tag. There can be many
    meta tags specified. 
    ```
    HTML Meta: http-equiv="refresh" content="30"
    ```
    Use the value `clear` to clear the list of meta tags.
    This can be used for example to exclude the default `viewport` meta tag that
    is emitted for proper viewing on mobile devices.

* `HTML Header`: The value is included literally in the 
    `<head>` section of the HTML document. 

* `HTML Footer`: The value is included literally at the end of the HTML
  document.

* `CSS Header`: The value is included literally in a `<style>` element in the
    `<head>` section of the HTML document.

* {#item-math} `Math Mode` (=`static`): The mathematics rendering mode: `static` or `dynamic`.
  In static mode, you can use the following keys to fine-tune the rendering:
    * `Math Dir:` _dir_ (=`math`): The relative directory where Madoko
        stores the images for the math formulas. All images can also be embedded
        in the web page if you set `Math Embed` high enough.
    * `Math Dpi:` _dpi_ (=`300`): The resolution at which the images are rendered.
        The default is a fairly high resolution. Decrease it to make the
        generated images smaller. Use the `-vv` flag to see the sizes of
        all the images generated for formulas.
    * `Math Scale:` _scale_ (=`108`): Scaling in percentage used for all math. The default looks 
        quite good for most fonts, but you may want to change it depending
        on the main font used.
    * `Math Embed:`_size_ (=`1`): Limit in kilobytes at which images are embedded
        in the HTML page instead of separate `.png` images. Set it to `0`
        to never embed an image, and high enough to always embed.
    * `Latex:` _cmd_ (=`latex`): The command used to invoke LaTeX when rendering
        math to a `.dvi` file.
    * `Dvipng:` _cmd_ (=`dvipng`): The command used to generate `.png` images
        from the `.dvi` file generated by LaTeX.
    * `Math Pdf Latex:` _cmd_ (=`xelatex`): The command used to invoke LaTeX when 
        rendering math that requires a `.pdf`.
    * `Convert:` _cmd_ (=`convert`): Specify the `convert` command that is executed
        for images that are generated from `.pdf` output (like PSTricks, or TikZ). 
    
  The following keys are used when math mode is dynamic:

    * `MathJax` (=false): Set this key to the path of your MathJaX script.
        Set this key to `True` to include the standard secure script
        to the latest MathJaX installation on the [CDN network][mathjax-cdn].
        ```
        MathJax: True   
        ``` 
    * `MathJax Ext`: requires that the `MathJax` is key is set. Adds a MathJaX
        extension to the loaded scripts. See Section [#sec-mathext] for more 
        information.

### LaTeX keys

For LaTeX output, the following keys are relevant:

* `Document Class` or `Doc Class` (=book): Specify the LaTeX document class. Can be 
   prefixed with its options using square brackets:

        Document Class: [9pt]article
  
  ~ MadokoNet
  When leaving out the extension, Madoko assumes this
  is a standard LaTeX document class (available from CTAN). If an extension
  is given, the file is loaded (or created) from the current directory.
  ~

* `Package`: Specify a LaTeX package that is included via `\usepackage`.
    The package name can be prefixed with its options using square brackets.

        Package: fancyhdr
        Package: [colorlinks=true]hyperref

    If the package name ends with `.tex` and has no options, it will be
    included using the `\input` command instead.
    You can clear the package list using `Package: clear`. This can be
    used to not include the default `madoko.sty` package.

    Sometimes, a package does not work when typesetting mathematics
    in plain LaTeX. This can happen for example if the rest of the document
    needs a package that only loads in some other latex engine, like XeLaTeX.
    In that case, you can exclude the package when typesetting basic math by 
    using the star option:
    ```
    Package*: pgfplots
    ```

    ~ MadokoNet
    When leaving out the extension, Madoko assumes this
    is a standard LaTeX package (available from CTAN). If an extension
    is given, the file is loaded (or created) from the current directory.
    ~

* `Tex Header`: The value is included as is before
    the `\begin{document}` command of the LaTeX output. 

* `Tex Header*`: The value is included as is before
    the `\begin{document}` command of the LaTeX output but excluded
    when rendering basic mathematics.

* `Maketitle`: Usually we use this in the form `@tex Maketitle: True`
    to make Madoko issue the `\maketitle` command for the title and
    authors instead of using the Madoko styling.

### Metadata modes { #sec-modes }

Sometimes it is convenient to apply a certain metadata rule only for specific
output formats or specific situations. For this you can specify a _mode_.
For example, to only add a logo when generating HTML, you can
say:

    @html Logo: True
    
You can also negate modes by prefixing with "no". To make all subsections
blue except when generating a PDF, you can say:

    @notex ~h2: color=blue

Currently, the following modes are defined by Madoko:

* `@html`: defined when generating HTML output.
* `@tex` : defined when generating LaTeX/PDF output.
* `@preview`: defined when generating HTML in the [Madoko.net] preview.

## Entities     { #sec-entity }

Madoko uses entities extensively. If Madoko finds an entity name (`&`_name_`;`)
it looks up the name in various places: if there is a block
element with that _id_, the entity name is replaced by the _label_ value of that block
(see Section [#sec-ids-labels]). If there is no block with that identity, 
Madoko looks if there is a metadata value with that name, and replaces the
entity name with its value:

~ Sample
The title of this document is "&title;".\
And this section has label &sec-entity;.\
Standard entities are looked up last &Delta;&hArr;&delta;.
~

Entity names for labels and metadata values, can consist of letters, underscores, 
minus signs, and digits. In contrast to regular HTML entity names, Madoko compares
the entity name for labels and metadata in a case-insensitive way.

Note that if label or metadata values contain themselves entities, these are 
expanded recursively (up to a certain limit) which can provide a powerful abstraction
mechanism. For example, if we define a metadata value `Title2`:

    Title2: (&Title;,&Title;)

then the entity `&Title2;` expands to "&Title2;". 

If entity names are used inside [attributes][#sec-attr], Madoko first
looks for the name as one of the attribute key values. For example, you can
use names like `&id;`, `&class;`, and `&label;`. 

Some predefined metadata keys are quite useful as entities:

* `&date;`. The current (compilation) date in [ISO 8601] international format.
* `&time;`. The current (compilation) time in [ISO 8601] international format.
* `&year;`,`&month;`,`&day;`. The current year, month, and day.
* `&hours;`,`&minutes;`,`&seconds;`. The current hours, minutes, and seconds.
* `&madoko-version`. The version of the Madoko compiler.
* `&docname;`. The file name of the document without extension and directory.
* `&filename;`. The full file name of the document.
* `&eg;`. Expands to "&eg;" ("_exempli gratia_", "for example").
* `&ie;`. Expands to "&ie;" ("_id est_", "that is" or "in other words").
* `&etal;`. Expands to "&etal;" ("_et alii_", "and others").

There are also a few special entity names:

* `&nl;`. Expands to the newline character.
* `&br;`. Expands to a forced line break (i.e. `<br>`).
* `&null;`. Expands to an empty string.
* `&source;`. Inside attributes, expands to the literal content of the element.
* `&&;`. Expands to the literal `&` character. This is necessary
    sometimes since entity expansion is done recursively without regard for other
    formatting attributes. For example, if you have a metadata value `Foo` that
    needs to expand to `` `&amp;` ``, you would need to write it as:
    ```
    Foo: `&&;amp;`
    ```
    or otherwise the `&amp;` part would get expanded even within the back ticks.
    The reason why Madoko expands regardless of other formatting is to allow powerful
    abstraction where we can for example build up regular expressions from smaller parts.

For some examples of the usage of these elements, see Sections [#sec-replace] and [#sec-reset].

## Attributes and Styling       { #sec-styling }

Writing Madoko documents is clearly about content: the main advantage of using
a markdown format is that it allows the writer to concentrate on prose and
content instead of formatting. However, in the final stages it is desirable to
_style_ a document to make it look good. This section describes some tricks
and tips that can help doing this well. 

### Attributes  { #sec-attr }

An essential addition of Madoko is good support for attributes. The syntax is
similar to attribute definitions in [Kramdown], [Pandoc], and [MultiMarkdown],
and denoted between curly braces:

    { .class #id key=value }

For most block elements, like lists, paragraphs, block quotes, etc, you can 
write attributes on the line directly following the block. For list items,
the attributes directly follow the item:

~ Sample
This is a paragraph in small-caps.
{ font-variant=small-caps} 

* {color=navy} This is a 'mylist' 
* in italics
{ .mylist font-style="italic" }
~

For fenced code blocks, custom blocks, and headers, the attributes are specified on the first 
line.

For inline elements, you can follow links, images, code, and bracketed text (between
`[` and `]`) with attributes. Bracketed text with attributes become a `<span>` in 
the HTML backend.
It is of course recommended to put attributes when possible in 
link or image definitions themselves:

~ Sample
Here is an ![butterfly] image. 
With [bold]{font-weight=bold} text, and even the
T[E]{vertical-align=-0.5ex margin-left=-0.25ex \
     margin-right=-0.25ex}X
logo.

[butterfly]: butterfly.png { width=100px vertical-align=top }
~


Note that inside attributes, and also metadata values,
a backslash followed by a newline acts as a line joiner and removes the newline
and the following whitespace before processing the attributes. This is convenient
when defining long strings inside attributes. For example, if a figure has a long
caption, we could write it as:

    ~ Figure { #myfigure \
               caption="Here is a really \
                        long caption." }
    ...
    ~

To get a literal line break inside an attribute string, use the entity `&nl;` instead.

### CSS formatting attributes  { #sec-css }

Attributes that are not special to Madoko (as described in Section [#sec-specialattr]),
are passed as CSS style attributes in the HTML backend. For the LaTeX backend,
Madoko includes special style files (`css.sty` and `madoko.sty`) that process
many CSS formatting commands (and ignores all others). Currently formatting
commands that are recognized across backends are:

* `display=`(`block`|`inline`|`block-inline`|`hidden`)
* `margin=`(`auto`|_length_)
* `margin-left`,`margin-right`,`margin-bottom`,`margin-top`
* `padding=`(`auto`|_length_)
* `padding-left`,`padding-right`,`padding-bottom`,`padding-top`
* `width=`_length_
* `height=`_length_
* `vertical-align=`(`top`|`middle`|`bottom`|`baseline`|_length_)
* `border-style=`(`none`|`solid`|`dotted`)
* `border-left-style`, `border-right-style`.
* `border-top-style`, `border-bottom-style`.
* `border-width=`_length_
* `border-color=`_color_
* `text-align=`(`center`|`right`|`left`|`justify`)
* `text-indent=`_length_
* `line-height=`_length_
* `font-style=`(`italic`|`oblique`|`normal`)
* `font-variant=`(`small-caps`|`normal`)
* `font-weight=`(`bold`|`normal`)
* `font-size=`(`xx-small`|`x-small`|`small`|`medium`|`large`|`x-large`|`xx-large`)
* `font-family=`(`monospace`|`serif`|`sans-serif`|`normal`|_family_)
* `color=`_color_
* `background-color`=_color_.
* `penalty=`_number_
* `page-align=`(`top`|`bottom`|`here`|`forcehere`). Used for `Figure` custom blocks 
    (see Section [#sec-predef-custom]).
* `float=`(`left`|`right`). Limited support at this time in LaTeX.

Note that the syntax at this point is quite a bit more restrictive
than plain CSS. For example, we cannot just say:

    { border="solid 1px" }

as in CSS, but need to state each property separately as:

    { border-style=solid border-width=1px }

Also, _length_\/s must use common units, such as `10ex`, `5em`, `4px`, `2cm`,
or `-6pt` for example. Percentages only work for width's.

A font family can be a comma separated list of fonts. However, in LaTeX
only the last font in the list is used. If it is not one of the standard
font families (`serif`, `sans-serif`, `monospace`), it is selected using 
the `\fontspec` command.

~~ Sample
~ { font-family=Georgia }
This is in the Georgia font.
~
~~

A _color_ can be standard named color or use any of the CSS color
formats, namely:

* `#rrggbb` (or `#rgb`) where `xx` is hexadecimal, &eg; `#0000FF` []{.cbox background-color=#0000FF}.
* `rgb(r,g,b)` where each component is a number between 0 and 255, or a percentage, 
  &eg; `rgb(50%,50%,100%)` []{.cbox background-color=rgb(50%,50%,100%)}
* `hsl(h,s,l)` where `h` is an angle between 0 and 360, and `s` and `l` percentages. 
  Use `50%` for the default lightness, 
  &eg; `hsl(240,100%,80%)` []{.cbox background-color=hsl(240,100%,80%)}.

The recognized named colors are the basic CSS colors shown in
Figure [#fig-colors].

~ Figure { #fig-colors caption="The basic CSS colors"}
| Name               | Hex value   | Color                                  |
| :----------------- | :---------- | :----------------------------------:   |
|                    |             |                                        |

| DarkGray           | #A9A9A9     | []{.cbox background-color=darkgray}    |
| Silver             | #C0C0C0     | []{.cbox background-color=silver}      |
| LightGray          | #D3D3D3     | []{.cbox background-color=lightgray}   |
| White              | #FFFFFF     | []{.cbox background-color=white}       |
| Gainsboro          | #DCDCDC     | []{.cbox background-color=gainsboro}   |
| FloralWhite        | #FFFAF0     | []{.cbox background-color=FloralWhite} |
| Ivory              | #FFFFF0     | []{.cbox background-color=ivory}       |
{.booktable}
~

If you would like to use another named color that is not one of the above,
you can often just define an entity in the metadata:

    Indigo: #4B0082

and use Madoko's expansion to use it inside an attribute:

~ Sample
This is "[Indigo]{color=&Indigo;}".
~

In general, it is hard to emulate a complex CSS layout in LaTeX so some
particular combinations may not work as expected in LaTeX. We strive to make
it work seamlessly though so please [report any issues][issues].
Nevertheless, the above formatting commands should suffice in most situations
and we can program already many fancy examples:

~ Sample
[**Aaaa[a]{vertical-align=-0.3ex}
[aa]{vertical-align=-0.7ex}
[r]{vertical-align=-1.4ex}
[g]{vertical-align=-2.5ex}
[h]{vertical-align=-5ex}**]{font-size=large height=0pt }
he shouted but not even the next
one in line noticed that something
terrible had happened to him.
{width=18em border-style=solid border-width=1px \
 padding=1ex background-color=FloralWhite}
~

~ HtmlOnly
This is rendered in LaTeX as shown by the following screenshot:

![aargh]
{text-indent=1em}
~

[aargh]: aargh.png "PDF screen capture of the Aargh example." { width=19em }

### Floating blocks  { #sec-float }

There is limited support for the `float` attribute but it is generally quite hard
to emulate this well in LaTeX. However, one can use the `float` attribute to put
figures or general custom blocks on the left- or right-side of a page and have
text flow around it. For example:

<!--
~ Begin Sample
~ Figure { caption="A formula" xwidth=50% float=left xmargin-right=1em }
~~ Math
e = mc^2 
~~
~
"Aarghhh", he shouted but not even the next
one in line noticed that something
terrible had happened to him. 
"Aarghhh", he shouted but not even the next
one in line noticed that something
terrible had happened to [him.]{float=right} 
~ End Sample
-->

Note that it is important to give a specific width when specifying `float`.
Also, in LaTeX, the height of the text flowing around the float is not always
correct (especially if the text contains mathematics). To fine-tune the appearance
in LaTeX, one can use the `lines` key to give the height of the float figure in 
text lines.

Still the LaTeX command is fragile and generally works best when immediately
followed by a paragraph. Also, when using `float` on inline elements, it is
implemented in LaTeX simply using `\hfill` which is hopefully enough for most 
common situations.

### Special attribute keys  { #sec-specialattr}

Normally, attributes are always passed to LaTeX as is, and in the HTML passed as 
CSS attributes. However, you can use special prefixes to have them end up at other
places:

* `html-`_name_: use _name_ as an HTML attribute only in the HTML
    backend. For example, you can use `html-target=_top` for links inside
    frames.
* `css-`_name_: use _name_ as a CSS attribute only in the HTML backend.
    For example, you can use `css-font-family=Cambria` for setting a font
    family only in the web page.
* `tex-`_name_: use _name_ as an attribute only in the LaTeX backend.
* `data-`_name_: in the HTML backend uses a HTML attribute `data-`_name_
    instead of a CSS style attribute. Passed to LaTeX as is.

Some attributes have a special meaning to Madoko. In particular:

* `tight`: Suppresses enclosing the first text content in this block as a paragraph.
    This is used for example for a `BibItem` block. 
* `notag`: Suppresses the output of a `div` tag (or LaTeX environment) for a custom block.
* `toc`, `toc-line`, `toc-depth`: Used for generating custom table of contents. Used
    for example by headings. See Section [#sec-toc] for more information.
* `before`, `replace`, and `after`: Used to transform the content of the block. See 
    Section [#sec-replace].
* `start=`_num_: Gives the start number for an ordered list (Section [#sec-lists]).
* `target=`_frame_: Gives the HTML frame target for a link. 
* `math-needpdf`: If `true`, forces the `pdf` conversion method for an equation (instead
    of using `dvi`). This is needed when using fancy LaTeX math using TikZ for example.
* `snippet-needpdf`: If `false`, uses the `dvi` conversion method for a snippet (instead
    of using `pdf`). This can improve performance of image extraction. (Section [#sec-mathefficiency]).
* `html-elem=`_elem_: Use _elem_ as the HTML element instead of `div` or
    `span` for block and inline elements respectively.
* `tex-elem=`_elem_: Uses _elem_ as the TeX environment or command
   instead of `\mdDiv` or `\mdSpan` respectively.
* `id=`_id_: Sets the _id_ of an element. Usually this is done using a
    hash name directly as `#`_id_.
* `class=`_classes_: Adds to the classes of this element. Usually set
    using a dot name as in `.`_class_. If you use `class=clear`, the
    classes are cleared. Similarly, you can use `.`_class_`=clear` to
    remove one particular class.
* `label=`_label_: Sets the label of an element. This is used when
    referencing this block as explained in Section [#sec-ids-labels]
* `caption=`_caption`: Sets the caption of figure as explained in
   Section [#sec-figure].
* `cite-label=`_label_: Sets the citation label of an `BibItem` block.
    This is used when referencing a bibliography item as explained in
    Section [#sec-bib]
* `cite-style=`_style_: Sets the citation style for a citation (Section [#sec-cite]).
* `lines=`_lines_: Set the height of a float figure to _lines_ height
  (Section [#sec-float]).
* `sticky`: The attributes for this element will stick to apply to all of
    the same elements that follow in the document.
* `-`: clear any attributes that have been set before (usually through metadata rules).
* `input=`_input_. Sets the input mode of this block which determines how
    the content of this block is processed. One of:
    - `pre`: Preformatted code (Section [#sec-pre]).
    - `raw`: Raw unprocessed input that is passed directly to the output.
    - `texraw`: Raw TeX code that is passed directly to LaTeX (See [`TeXRaw`][#sec-custom])
    - `htmlraw`: Raw HTML code that is passed directly to the HTML output (See [`HtmlRaw`][#sec-custom])
    - `math`: LaTeX mathematics mode input. This input is usually invoked through an `Equation` 
        block as described in Section [#sec-math].
    - `mathpre`: Preformatted LaTeX mathematics. This input is usually invoked through a `MathPre` block (Section [#sec-mathpre]).
    - `mathdefs`: LaTeX math definitions. This input is usually invoked through a `MathDefs` block (Section [#sec-mathdefs]).
    - `normal`, `markdown`: Regular Madoko markdown input (default).
    - `texonly`: Regular Madoko markdown that is only processed when generating LaTeX output.
        Usually used through the `TexOnly` block (Section [#sec-custom]).
    - `htmlonly`: Regular Madoko markdown that is only processed when generating HTML output.
        Usually used through the `HtmlOnly` block (Section [#sec-custom]).

### Special attribute classes

Some class attributes are treated specially by Madoko. In particular:

* `.preview`. This class is set on the `<body>` element in the preview and
   can be used to style elements differently in the preview versus the
   full document.
* `.para-block`. If a block element has the `.para-block` class, it will
    considered part of the preceding paragraph (and not end that
    paragraph). This is for example done for the `Equation` block since
    equations are part of a paragraph. This improves typography
    significantly, especially for the LaTeX backend. Madoko will also
    assign the `para-continue` class to the paragraph preceding a
    `.para-block` element.
* `.para-end`: Normally, equations have a `.para-block` class and are
    thus considered part of the paragraph. If you would like such block
    to be the end of a paragraph, you should assign the `.para-end` class
    to end it explicitly. In the LaTeX backend this will cause the next
    paragraph to be indented.
* `.indent`. This class is automatically added by Madoko to any paragraph
    that follows other paragraphs or `.para-block`s (and is not inside a
    list). This can be used to switch from _block_ mode paragraphs to
    _indented_ paragraphs using some CSS rules: `p.indent { text-indent: 1em }`
* `.align-center`, `.align-right`, `.align-left`. These classes align the
    _content_ of a block (instead of the block itself) to the center,
    right, or left.
* `.hidden`. Hides the content of the block.
* `.block`. Treat this as a block element instead of inline content. For
    example, in HTML output this will add a top and bottom margin to the
    element.
* `.wide`. Used for `Figure` blocks: in a two-column output, this figure
    will span both columns horizontally (see also
    Section [#sec-predef-custom]).
* `.free`, `.textual`. These classes are used for typesetting citations
   (see Section [#sec-cite]).
* `.long`. Used to signify that a table might span multiple pages so that
    the LaTeX backend can use the `longtable` environment instead of the
    regular `tabular` environment (which cannot break across pages).
* `.list-star`, `.list-dash`, `.list-plus`. Used to customize appearance
  of bullets in a list.
* `.code`,`.code`_n_: added to inline code elements where _n_ is the
  number of back-quotes. This way you can add special styling to double
  quote inline code for example.
* `.pre-fenced`, `.pre-fenced`_n_: Added to fenced code blocks where _n_ is
  the number back-quotes.
* `.pre-indented`: Added to indented code blocks.
* `math-inline`: Added to inline math fragments.
* `math-display`: Added to block math fragments.

## Metadata rules           { #sec-rules }

Often, we need to apply specific attributes and formatting to certain elements
or custom blocks. This can be done using _metadata rules_. These rules
function much like regular CSS rules except that they are quite a bit more
limited. A rule starts with a tilde (`~`), dot (`.`), or hash character (`#`)
for matching a custom block, class name, or id respectively. The value of
a rule are attributes that get applied to any matching block.
Here are some examples:
    
    ~Blockquote : font-style=oblique
    .bold       : font-weight=bold
    #myblock    : border-width=1px border-style=solid

This would typeset a block quotes in an oblique font, any block with 
a `bold` class in bold, and the block with the `myblock` id with a solid border.
You can also use a comma separated list of matches that apply to all.
For example, we can give all code, inline or as a block, the class `prettyprint` as:

    ~Pre,~Code: .prettyprint


### Names of predefined elements

Most standard Madoko block elements, like lists or block quotes, can also be
targeted by rules. Their element names are the standard HTML names, namely:

~ Center
| Element                     | Name          |
| :---------------------------| :-------------|
| Paragraph                   | `p`           |
| Code block                  | `pre`         |
| Code inline                 | `code`        |
| Code escaped text           | `code-escaped`|
| Block quote                 | `blockquote`  |
| List                        | `ul`          |
| Numbered list               | `ol`          |
| List item                   | `li`          |
| Definition list             | `dl`          |
| Definition term             | `dt`          |
| Definition                  | `dd`          |
| Horizontal rule             | `hr`          |
| Table                       | `table`       |
| Heading                     | `h1`,...,`h6` |
| Unnamed custom block        | `div`         |
| Named custom block          | _name_        |
{.booktable}
~

Note that every custom block _blockname_ automatically also gets the class
_blockname_ and is thus matched by both `~`_blockname_ and `.`_blockname_ rules.
This can be also be useful when applying styles in CSS rules.

Some standard elements also get standard class names assigned
to make it easier to target them with specific rules:

~ Center
| Element                          | Class name       |
| :--------------------------------| :----------------|
| Code block that was indented     | `.pre-indented`  |
| Code block that was fenced       | `.pre-fenced`    |
| Code block with _n_ back-quotes  | `.pre-fenced`_n_ |
| Code inline with _n_ back-quotes | `.code`_n_       |
| Math inline                      | `.math-inline`   |
| Math block                       | `.math-display`  |
| List using `*`                   | `.list-star`     |
| List using `+`                   | `.list-plus`     |
| List using `-`                   | `.list-dash`     |
{.booktable}
~

For example, you could specify that any indented code blocks
should use the javascript syntax highlighter:

    .pre-indented: language=javascript

Or typeset double-quoted inline code (&ie; ``` ``code`` ```) with a gray background:

    .code2: background-color=Gainsboro
    

### Advanced: Styling in CSS 

Sometimes we only want to apply certain styling to just HTML.
For HTML, styling through classes works best: we can simply write some CSS
(and include it through the `Css` metadata or directly within `<style>`
tags.). For example,

    <style>
    .slanted { font-style: oblique; font-family: Cambria }
    </style>

Note that any custom block in Madoko (like `~ Slanted`) automatically gets
assigned the class name `slanted` and can thus be matched easily in CSS.

For styling in LaTeX, or when certain CSS keys are not yet processed in
LaTeX, see Appendix [#sec-latex-style].


## Numbering    { #sec-numbering }

For larger documents, numbering sections, figures, tables, images, etc. is
quite important and Madoko supports this well. By default, Madoko will number
headers, figures, and equations. Numbering for headers is by default up to 3
levels, but it can be set for the document using the `Heading depth` meta
variable. If it is set to zero, it suppresses numbering for headings completely:    

    Heading Depth: 0


### Advanced: Custom numbering

The numbering can be completely customized though. Counters are introduced
using `@`_name_ syntax in attributes. When such counter name occurs, it is
automatically incremented. If the value of a _label_ contains a counter name,
it is replaced by its current value. For example, the default attributes for
equations contain:

    { @equation label="(@equation)" }

This automatically will increment the `@equation` counter at each occurrence of
an equation block element, and set its label to the current value surrounded by
parenthesis. Similarly, the default label for main sections is defined as:

    { @h1 label="@h1" }

Actually, Madoko automatically increments counters with the same name as the block,
so in the previous two cases, we should leave out `@equation` and `@h1` or we
do double increments. 

Of course, for headers we like to display the label by default in front of the
header text. This can be done using the [before][#sec-replace] attribute where
we use the [`&label;`][#sec-entity] key to insert the value of the label. So,
the full definition for level 1 headings is:

    { label="@h1" before="&label;.&ensp;" }


### Advanced: Reset counters { #sec-reset }

If a counter has a dash in its name, of the form `@`_prefix_`-name`, then the
counter will be reset on every increment of the counter _prefix_. For example,
the counter for subsections is reset on every new section (using [metadata
rules][#sec-rules]):

    ~h2: @h1-h2 label="@h1.@h1-h2" before="&label;.&ensp;"

Similarly, a counter like `@h1-h2-h3` would reset on every increment of
counter `@h1` or `@h1-h2`.

### Advanced: Display format 

The counters above are displayed as arabic numbers but sometimes we would like to
display a number using other formats. When you assign a single letter to a counter, it
will continue counting using letters. This is nice for example when starting
the appendix where each section is generally numbered using letters:

    # Appendix (not numbered at all)   {-}
    
    # Section one of the appendix { @h1="A" }
    This section will be numbered as 'A'

    # Another appendix section
    This section will be numbered as 'B'

The display format of a counter can also be set independently of setting its
value. Currently, Madoko supports `arabic`, `arabic0`, `upper-case`, and `lower-case`
display, where `arabic0` starts counting at 0. 
Assigning a single letter, like `@h1="A"` in the previous example is
just a shorthand for:

    { @h1=upper-case @h1=1 }

As a final example, suppose we would like to count figures using  lower-case
letters and per section. We can do this by defining the default attributes for
figures as a metadata rule:

    ~Figure: @h1-figure=lower-case @h1-figure label="@h1\/-@h1-figure" 

The label definition here displays figure labels of the form `2-b` for
example (where we used the empty [escape sequence][#sec-escapes] `\/` to
prevent the counter name `@h1` being read as `@h1-`). Note that because
this is a metadata rule, we could not use the assignment `@h1-figure="a"`
here, or otherwise every figure would get numbered as `a`. In this case
we just want to set the display mode here and not a specific value. Also
note that we still need to explicitly increment the counter too (using a
plain `@h1-figure`) since just setting the display format does not
increment the counter.

## Advanced: Replacement { #sec-replace }

Madoko has three attributes that can transform the content of block or inline
element, namely `before`, `after`, and `replace`. The `before` and `after`
elements just add content before and after:

~~ Sample
~ Myblock { before="*Myblock*: " after="." }
the content
~
~~

The `replace` attribute replaces the entire content with its value. You can
have multiple replacers and they are all applied in order. The replacers can
be cleared using the special `clear` value. Finally, all replacers can contain
entity names (Section [#sec-entity]) which are expanded. Useful entities are
`&source;` which expands to the current content of the block (possibly having
already some replacers applied), and `&nl;` which expands to a newline
character. In particular, `before` and `after` are defined in terms of
`replace`, where `before=`_value_  is just syntactic sugar for
`replace=`_value_`\/&source;` and similarly for `after`.

As an advanced example, for this document I defined a metadata rule for  the
`Sample` custom block that replaces its content by both a code block and a
regular markdown block. In a simplified form, it is defined as:

    ~Sample: 
      replace="~ Begin SampleBlock&nl;\
                 ````&nl;&source;&nl;````&nl;\
                 ---- &nl;&source;&nl;\
               ~ End SampleBlock"



### Advanced: Regular expression replacement    { #sec-regex }

A `replace` attribute can also define a general [regular expression][regex] replacement
of the form `/`_regex_`/`_replacer_`/`(`g`|`i`|`m`|`c`)?. The regular expression _regex_
is matched against the content, and a match is replaced by _replacer_. The options are:

* `g`: instead of just the first match, it will globally replace all matches found in the content.
* `i`: use case-insensitive matching.
* `m`: do a multi-line match where `^` and `$` match the beginning and end of each line respectively
    instead of just the start and end of the content.
* `c`: do case conversion; enlarges valid escape characters with one of `luLUE` which can be
    used to do case conversion, see the next section for more information.

[regex]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions

Inside the _replacer_ we can use the following escape sequences:

* `\`_digit_: gets replaced by the _digit_ capture group in _regex_.
* `\/`: becomes a forward slash.
* `\\`: becomes a single backward slash.

For example, here is an example where we replace `<`quoted`>` text by 
single guillemet quotes:

~~ Sample
~ { replace="/<(.*?)>/&lsaquo;\1&rsaquo;/g" }
Here is < quoted > text.
~
~~

#### Case conversion {#sec-case}

When we pass the `c` flag, we can also use special case conversion escape sequences
in the _replacer_ expression:

* `\U` or `\L` transform the following text up to the next `\E` (or the end of the
    replacement) to upper- or lower-case respectively.
* `\u` and `\l` replace the following character to upper- or lower-case.

~~ Sample
~ { replace="/(\w+)/\u\1/gc" }
all words to title-case.
~
~~

#### Mapping strings { #sec-map }

The `replace` attribute can also perform a _mapping_ when it
has the form: 

> `//` _regex~1~_ `/` _repl~1~_ `//` ... `//` _regex~n~_ `/` _repl~n~_ `//(`g`|`i`|`m`|`c`)`.

A mapping matches against the regular expression `(`_regex~1~_`)|`...`|(`_regex~n~_`)`,
and when it finds a match on some group _i_, it applies the replacer _repl~i~_. 
The replacement expression can use capture groups as usual.

For example, we could device a _greek_ or _hiragana_ mode replacement. Here is a simplified
example:

~~ Sample
~ Greek { replace="//a/&alpha;//d/&delta;//n/&nu;//g" }
greek daan.
~
~ Hiragana {replace="//ko/&#12371;//ni/&#12395;//\
            \\(.)/\1//chi/&#12385;//ha/&#12399;//\
            n/&#12435;//g" \
            font-family="MS Gothic" }
konnichiha is Japa\nese.
~
~~

Note that the previous example generally needs a `font-family` specification
to display correctly in LaTeX since Japanese characters are not in the
standard font. See Appendix [#sec-unicode] for more information.

### Advanced recursion and replacement

As more advanced example of recursion and replacement, we can actually
calculate  [fibonacci numbers][fib]. In the following sample, _n_ number of
`x` characters are replaced by _fib(n)_ `y` characters: 

~~ Sample 
How many `y`'s is the Fibonacci of 5 `x`'s?
~ Fib 
xxxxx
~  
~~

This is done through the following metadata rule:

    ~Fib: replace='/^x?$/y/' 
          replace='/xx(x*)/~Fib&nl;x\1&nl;~&nl;~Fib&nl;\1&nl;~/' 
          notag tight 

The first replacer will replace a single optional `x` with a `y`.  The second
one matches 2 or more `x`'s, and replaces these recursively by two  new `Fib`
blocks: one with _n-1_ and one with _n-2_ `x` characters. These blocks will
get processed now recursively. Finally, by using the `notag` attribute we
suppress the inclusion of many `div` elements in the HTML, while the `tight`
attribute suppresses the addition of paragraph elements.

This example shows the replacement facility of Madoko is quite powerful.
It is even possible to define a generic [SKI combinator expander][ski] which
makes Madoko's replacement mechanism (almost) Turing complete[^turing].

[fib]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number
[ski]: http://madoko.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest#test/new/extra_ski.text
[^turing]: Almost, since Madoko expands only up to a certain limit and since
    regular expressions cannot express arbitrary nesting levels.

## Command line options { #sec-commandline  }

Generally Madoko is invoked on the command line as:

* `madoko` \[_options_] _files_

where the options can consist of:

|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Short             | Long                   | Description                                     |

| `-v`              | `--verbose`            | Be more verbose.                                |
|                   | `--odir=`_dir_         | Write output files to the specified directory.  |
|                   | `--xmp`                | Only process markdown between `<xmp>` tags.     |
|                   | `--tex`                | Output a LaTeX file too.                        |
|                   | `--pdf`                | Generate a PDF file (implies `--tex`).          |
| `-f`              | `--fragment`           | Generate a fragment instead of a full document. |
|                   | `--logo`               | Add a 'Created with Madoko.net' message.        |
|                   | `--sandbox`            | Run in a sandbox for secure server execution.   |
|                   | `--sanitize`           | Always escape or suppress user defined html.    |
|                   | `--pedantic`           | Pedantic mode.                                  |
|                   | `--bench`              | For benchmarking: turn off numbering,  etc.     |
|                   | `--installdir=`_dir_   | Set installation directory explicitly.          |
| `-r`              | `--rebuild`            | Force rebuild bibliography, math, etc.          |
| `-m`_key_`:`_val_ | `--meta=`_key_`:`_val_ | Semi-colon separated list of metadata values    |
|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
{.booktable}

All the boolean flags can be negated by prefixing them with `no-`, for example
to suppress the logo message at the end of a document, use `--no-logo`.

The verbose flag (`-v`) can be repeated to become more verbose. For example, 
by using `-vv` LaTeX warnings and the size of math images are displayed.

Normally, Madoko writes the output files to the same directory as where the
input file resides but you can override this with the `--odir` option.  The
HTML output for a file _file_`.mdk` consists of _file_`.html` and
`madoko.css`. The latter contains standard styling for Madoko and is necessary
for example to display lines in tables correctly. For LaTeX output (`--tex`),
Madoko also emits _file_`.tex` and two style files, `css.sty` and
`madoko.sty`, which contain necessary commands to  process the Madoko output
in LaTeX.

The `--xmp` option instructs Madoko to only process content between
`<xmp>` and `</xmp>` tags. This can be useful if the main body of your document is
in HTML and only some parts are written in Madoko. 

The `--fragment` flag forces Madoko to generate a document fragment. By
default, a _full_ document is generated which is self sufficient and
contains for example for HTML proper `<head>` and `<body>` elements
instead of just the markup for the content. Similarly, for LaTeX, a full
document contains an `\documentclass`, `\begin{document}` and necessary
`\usepackage` commands. For a fragment, just the content is generated without
those headers and footers.

The `-m` flag can be used to set metadata values. For example, when specifying
what command to use to invoke LaTeX, we can say `-mpdflatex:/foo/bar/xelatex`
for example.

The `--sandbox` flags runs Madoko in a sandbox: it can only read files
underneath the current directory, the output directory, and include
paths, and it can only write files underneath the output directory.
Moreover, documents cannot change the following metadata keys: `latex`,
`pdflatex`, `dvipng`, `math-pdflatex`, `bibtex`, `math-convert`,
`convert`, `ps2pdf`, and `dvips`. Note that this flag only influences
the Madoko program, any run of LaTeX or other external programs need
to be secured separately.

## Slide shows and presentations { #sec-presentations }

Madoko can generate excellent slide shows using either the 
[reveal.js] library in HTML or the [Beamer] package in LaTeX. 

Start a slide show with including the `Presentation` style at
the start of the document:

    [INCLUDE=presentation]

Slides are now automatically started on a level 1 (`#`) or 2 (`##`) header, or
by using a `~Slide` custom block explicitly. Use the `.fragment` class on any
element to create overlays that appear one by one. The `.fragmented` class can
be used on a list to have each item appear in order. For example:

    # my first slide
    
    And some content
    
    And more
    {.fragment}
    
    And more
    {.fragment}
    
    # and my second slide
    
    * with
    * a list
    * in it
    {.fragmented}

The HTML slide shows support the `~Notes` custom block for speaker notes,
and the `~Vertical` custom block to create a set of vertical slides.

Here is a small [example slide show][slide] written in Madoko
 ([html][slide], [pdf][slide-pdf], [source][slide-mdk]).

### Using Reveal.js

The HTML backend works with the [reveal.js] library:

* It uses the reveal.js [library][github-reveal] from a common CDN url. You
  can set your own using the `Reveal Url` metadata:
  ```{language=madoko}
  Reveal Url: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/reveal.js/2.6.2
  ```
* Select another default theme by setting the `Reveal Theme`, for example `Reveal Theme: sky`.
* Use the `data-background` attribute on headings to set the background color or
    background image for a slide. 
* Use the `data-transition` attribute on headings to set the transition animation.
  For example:
  ```{language=madoko}
  # Slide  { data-transition=zoom }
  ## Next slide
  ```
* The Javascript `revealConfig` variable contains the default configuration options
    and can be extended inside `<script>` tags.

### Using Beamer

The LaTeX backend uses the [Beamer] package: 

* Set the `Beamer Theme` metadata key to select another theme, like `singapore` for example.
* Set the `Beamer Theme Options` for different options for the theme.
* Use the `.pause` class to insert pauses anywhere in a slide.

## Advanced: Customizing citations { #sec-custom-cite }

For each citation, you can actually change how it is displayed by setting
the `cite-style` attribute on the citations:

~ Sample
First a natural citation [@Goo93]{cite-style=natural},
then a super one[@Goo93]{cite-style=super}.
~

Moreover, we can customize the formatting of citations by specifying 
braces etc. The general format of a citation style is: 

> _base_ \[`:`(`sort`|`nosort`)\] \[`:`_open_`,`_close_`,`_sep_ \[`,`_aysep_] \[`,` _yysep_]]

where _base_ is one of `natural`, `numeric`, `textual`, or `super`,
and the values _open_ to _yysep_ are double quoted strings:

* _open_: the opening brace.
* _close_: the closing brace.
* _sep_: separator between citations.
* _aysep_: Optional separator between authors and years. Equal to _sep_ by default.
* _yysep_: Optional separator between years with a common author. Equal to _aysep_ by default.

For example:

~ Sample
Switch to a compact bold numeric style
[@Goo93;@FBerg04]{cite-style='numeric:"[**","**]","**;**"'}
or an unsorted super style 
[@Lamport:Latex;@Knuth:Tex]{cite-style=super:nosort}
~

Clearly, one should usually only do this for the `Cite Style` metadata key,
and not sprinkle this kind of formatting through your prose.


## Advanced: Not using BibTeX {#sec-custom-bib}

If necessary, it is possible to completely circumvent using BibTeX and write
your bibliography entries by hand. First, we need to ensure Madoko will not 
run the BibTeX tool for us:

    BibTeX: False

Next, we write our bibliography entries inside a `Bibliography` block: 

    ~ Bibliography { caption="00" }
    ...
    ~

where the `caption` is only used in LaTeX output and should be a string that
is the widest label necessary for the numeric style. Inside the bibliography
block, you can put `Bibitem` blocks for each bibliography entry. For example:

    ~~ Bibitem { #WadlerThiemann03  }
    Philip Wadler and Peter Thiemann.
    _The marriage of effects and monads._
    ACM Trans. Comput. Logic, 4(1):1--32, 2003.
    ~~

Moreover, you can add a `caption` that is displayed when hovering over a
citation, and a `searchterm` that is used when the user clicks on the
magnifying glass icon:

    ~~ Bibitem { #WadlerThiemann03 \
       caption="Wadler and Thiemann: \
                The marriage of effects and monads" \
       searchterm="Wadler+Thiemann+Marriage+Effects+Monads" }
    Philip Wadler and Peter Thiemann.
    _The marriage of effects and monads._
    ACM Trans. Comput. Logic, 4(1):1--32, 2003.
    ~~

The above example is for numeric style citations.
For author-year citations, the entry should have an explicit `cite-label`:

    ~~ Bibitem { #remy cite-label='R&eacute;my(1993)' }
    Didier R&eacute;my. 
    _Type inference for records in a natural extension of ML._
    In Carl\ A. Gunter and John\ C. Mitchell, editors, 
    Theoretical Aspects Of Object-Oriented Programming. 
    Types, Semantics and Language Design. MIT Press, 1993.
    ~~

    ~~ Bibitem { id='nielson:polyeffect' \
    cite-label='Nielson et\ al.(1997)Nielson, Nielson, and Amtoft'}
    Hanne\ Riis Nielson, Flemming Nielson, and Torben Amtoft.
    _Polymorphic subtyping for effect analysis: 
    The static semantics._
    In Selected papers from the 5th LOMAPS Workshop on 
    Analysis and Verification of Multiple-Agent Languages, 
    pages 141--171, 1997. ISBN 3-540-62503-8.
    ~~

A `cite-label` should have the form _authors_`(`_year_`)`_longauthors_,
where the _longauthors_ are optional. Madoko parses these labels to
correctly format citations. 

## Advanced: packages in dynamic math mode { #sec-mathext }

In dynamic math mode packages are not loaded since MathJax cannot handle arbitrary
LaTeX packages. We need a special MathJax 'extension'. For example,
the [amscd][amscd] package is available as `AMScd` and we can use it in MathJax as:

    MathJax Ext: AMScd

Another package that is available in both Latex and MathJax is 
the [`mhchem`][mhchem] package:

    MathJax Ext: mhchem
    Package    : mhchem

which can be used to easily draw chemical formulas:

~~ Sample
~ Equation
\ce{C6H5-CHO}\quad
\ce{$A$ ->[\ce{+H2O}] $B$}\quad
\ce{SO4^2- + Ba^2+ -> BaSO4 v}
~
~~

In the previous examples, it may seem superfluous to specify both a MathJaX extension
and LaTeX package but not in all cases the names or package functionality happens to
be exactly the same.

## Advanced: Using Prettify to highlight code { #sec-gpretty }

If you are not fond of static highlighting, you can also highlight syntax
dynamically using [Google Prettify][GPretty]. Of course, this only works HTML
output, PDF output is still highlighted using Madoko.  To enable prettify,
first include the Google script in the metadata (see Section [#sec-metadata]):

``` 
Script: https://cdn.rawgit.com/google/code-prettify\
        /master/loader/run_prettify.js
```

and add the `.prettyprint` class using attributes:

~ Sample
``` javascript  { .prettyprint .linenums  }
function hi() { 
  return "hi"; 
}
```
~

Note that Madoko automatically disables static syntax highlighting in the HTML
output if the `.prettyprint` class is present.

## Advanced styling in LaTeX  { #sec-latex-style }

Sometimes we need to style LaTeX code specially, or handle cases where
the CSS elements are not yet supported by Madoko (as described in 
Section [#sec-css]).

For the LaTeX backend, all attributes are passed to the LaTeX commands,
and there are generic hooks to apply LaTeX formatting. For example, we
can include the following LaTeX commands in a `TexRaw` section to make
all `Slanted` custom blocks use a slanted font:

    ~ TexRaw
    \cssClassRule{slanted}{font-style=oblique}
    ~

The following commands are quite useful for this:

* `\cssClassRule{`_class_`}{`_attributes_`}`: adds _attributes_ to any command
    that contains _class_.
* `\cssClassRuleEnv{`_class_`}{`_env_`}`: encloses any block with class _class_ 
    in the LaTeX environment _env_ (after margins and padding). 
* `\cssClassRuleCmd{`_class_`}{\`_cmd_`}`: applies any content with class _class_ 
    to the single argument LaTeX command `\`_cmd_ (after margins and padding).
* `\cssClassRuleDoBefore{`_class_`}{`_cmds_`}`: execute commands _cmds_ before 
    formatting the content for any block that contains the class _class_ (but
    after margins and padding).
* `\cssClassRuleDoAfter{`_class_`}{`_cmds_`}`: execute commands _cmds_ after
    formatting the content for any block that contains the class _class_.
* `\cssClassRuleDo{`_class_`}{`_cmds_`}`: execute commands _cmds_ when processing
    the attributes. These _cmds_ can contain:
    * `\cssDoBefore{`_cmds_`}`: executes _cmds_ before formatting the contents.
    * `\cssDoAfter{`_cmds_`}`: execute _cmds_ after formatting the contents.
    * `\cssDoEnv{`_env_`}`: enclose the formatting in _env_.
* `\cssIfHasClass{`_class_`}{`_then_`}{`_else_`}`: This command is can be used
    inside _cmds_ of
    the `\cssClassDo`(`Before`|`After`|) commands. If this element has _class_
    then execute the _then_ part, else the _else_ part.
* `\cssNewKey{css}{`_attrname_`}{\css`_cmdname_`}{`_default_`}`: Define a new
    attribute _attrname_. When present its value gets bound to `\css`_cmdname_.
    The _default_ value is optional.
* `\cssNewLengthKey{css}{`_attrname_`}{\css`_cmdname_`}`: Define a new
    attribute _attrname_ that contains a length. When present its value gets
    bound to `\css`_cmdname_. The _default_ value is `0pt`.
* `\cssElemRule{`_elem_`}{`_attributes_`}`: adds _attributes_ to any custom block 
    _elem_. 
* `\cssElemRule`(`Env`|`Cmd`|`Do`|`DoBefore`|`DoAfter`). As the `Class` variants
    but for elements. In contrast to the `Class` rules, these variants will apply
    commands before margins and padding is applied. If this is not wanted, use the
    `Class` variant instead since those also match on element names.

Inside rules, you can also access most CSS attributes that defined through
`\cssNewKey` or `\cssNewLengthKey`. The attributes are named using camel casing 
with a `css` prefix, i.e. `\cssCamelCasing`,
where `text-indent` is stored in `\cssTextIndent`, or `border-left-style` as
`\cssBorderLeftStyle`.

As an advanced example, here is how `madoko.sty` defines the rules for the 
`Figure` custom block:

``` latex
\cssNewKey{css}{page-align}{\cssPageAlign}{}
\cssElemRuleDo{figure}{%
  \eifstrequal{\cssPageAlign}{top}%
    {\def\@pagealign{t}}%
  {\eifstrequal{\cssPageAlign}{bottom}%
    {\def\@pagealign{b}}%
  {\eifstrequal{\cssPageAlign}{here}%
    {\def\@pagealign{h}}%
    {\def\@pagealign{tbp}}}}% default
  \cssIfHasClass{wide}%
    {\cssDoBefore{\@expandafter{\begin{figure*}[}{\@pagealign}]}%
     \cssDoAfter{\end{figure*}}}%
    {\cssDoBefore{\@expandafter{\begin{figure}[}{\@pagealign}]}%
     \cssDoAfter{\end{figure}}}%
}

\newlength{\mdCaptionlen}
\newcommand{\mdCaption}[1]{%
  % center a caption if it is smaller than the line width
  \settowidth{\mdCaptionlen}{#1}%
  \ifnum\mdCaptionlen<\linewidth%
    \parbox{\linewidth}{\noindent\centering #1}%
  \else%
    \parbox{\linewidth}{\noindent #1}%
  \fi%
}
\cssClassRuleCmd{figure-caption}{\mdCaption}
\cssClassRule{figure-caption}{text-align=justify}
```
Where we recall that the standard metadata rules for a `Figure` are:

    ~Figure: label='[@figure]{.figure-label}' .align-center 
             after='&nl;********* {.figureline}&nl;\
                    [[**Figure\ &label;.** ]\
                    {.caption-before}&caption;]\
                    {.figure-caption}&nl;{notag}&nl;'
             toc=tof toc-line='&label;. &caption;'

as shown in Appendix [#app-custom]. The sample uses two extra functions from
`css.sty`:

* `\eifstrequal{`_str1_`}{`_str2_`}{`_then_`}{`_else_`}`: expands the
    content of _str1_ and then compares for equality with _str2_, and
    executes either the _then_ or _else_ branch. Use `\eeifstrequal` if
    both string arguments must be expanded.
* `\@expandafter{`_arg1_`}{`_arg2_`}`: first expands _arg2_ and then 
    continues executing _arg1_ (followed by the expansion of _arg2_).
    Used in the previous example to expand the optional argument to 
    the `figure` environment to one of `b`, `h`, or `t`.
    the `figure` environment to one of `b`, `h`, or `t`.

## Unicode characters { #sec-unicode }

Madoko already recognizes all named html entities and translates them to the
appropriate LaTeX commands (Appendix [#app-entities]). 
If you often need a specific unnamed unicode character, it can be
convenient to define a shorthand for it in the metadata:

    llb: &#10214;
    rrb: &#10215;

and then use those entity names instead. For example:

~ Sample 
&llb;hi&rrb;.
~

### Unicode in LaTeX

Unfortunately, in LaTeX these unicode characters are still unknown.
You can define your own definition for it using the
LaTeX `\mdDefineUnicode` command in a `TexRaw` block at the start of the
document. For example:

    ~ TeXRaw
    \mdDefineUnicode{10214}{\ensuremath{\llbracket}}
    \mdDefineUnicode{10215}{\ensuremath{\rrbracket}}
    ~

If no definition is given, LaTeX will work but output the entity as is,
i.e. `&#10214;` for `#llbracket`. Under a unicode aware LaTeX, like [XeLaTeX]
or [LuaLaTeX], it will call `\mdUnicodeChar` which will use the `\char` command
to directly select the glyph from the current font.

### Unicode font selection in LaTeX { #sec-unicode-latex }

The previous examples works fine if only some unicode characters are used, 
but becomes cumbersome if you need many unicode characters, for example,
when writing Japanese or Chinese characters as shown in our previous example
in Section [#sec-map]. In this case, we need to select a font family in LaTeX
that supports the glyphs directly. For example, `MS Gothic` or `SimSun`:
~~ Sample
~ { font-family="MS Gothic"}
&#12371;&#12435;&#12395;&#12385;&#12399; is Japanese.
~
~~

Instead of using explicit unicode characters, you can also directly
use UTF8 text files with the characters shown directly. For example:

~ Sample
Directly in unicode: [こんにちは]
(probably not visible in LaTeX monospace fonts)
~

If most of your document is using such characters, the `\setmainfont` command
of the `fontspec` package can set the default for the entire document instead
of using attributes. See the package [documentation][fontspec] for more information.

## Recognized character entities   { #app-entities }

Madoko recognizes all HTML5 named character entities and translates them
correctly in LaTeX. Besides the standard named entities, Madoko also
recognizes some extra named entities, like _bar_, _bslash_, 
_pagebreak_, _strut_, etc. These are denoted in the table with a star. The
full list of predefined entities is:

|--------|-------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| number | name        | glyph     | remark                                       |
